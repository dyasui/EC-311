## 📝 Course Description

This course equips students with essential theoretical and mathematical tools for understanding microeconomics.
Building on the foundational market supply and demand models from EC201, we delve into consumer and producer behavior by applying math to simplify real-world decision-making.

By the end of this course, students will be well-prepared to apply these models in upper-level elective courses, embark on their own research projects, and make informed decisions in the real-world economy.
Explore the materials to discover how microeconomic theory can enhance your understanding and approach to economic challenges!
