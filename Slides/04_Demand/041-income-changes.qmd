## Visualizing the Change

Let's start with a our standard optimized utility graph    

::: {.fragment}
![](Images/Inc-Change1.png){fig-align="center" width=600 height=500}
:::

. . .

What would happen if we [**Increase**]{.h} our income?

---

## Visualizing the Change

With an increase in income, our budget constraint will:

::: {.column width="50%"}

[Shift Outward]{.hi}

## More Goods 

The previous graphs tell us 

- When income $(M)$ goes up, you can now reach a higher IC and be better off (relatively)

- This graph also makes an important assumption

::: {.incremental}
- Both goods ,$x$ and $y$, are desirable 
    - We call these [Normal Goods]{.hi}
:::

. . .

[Normal Goods]{.hi} are desirable, which simply means that if we have more income we will consume more of them

---

## Other Types of Goods?

Does it always have to be the case that consumpution of both $x$ and $y$ has to increase in response to an increase in income?

. . .

No! There are goods we call [Inferior Goods]{.hi-red} 

::: {.incremental}
- These goods are consumed less when income increases 
- A classic example of this is Maruchan ramen noodles
:::

---

## Inferior Goods - Graph

Let $y$ be an inferior good, the optimized utility graph would look something like

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

[Maximized Utility]{.hi}

![](Images/Inferior-Good1.png)

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

[Increase in Income with Inferior Good $y$]{.hi}

::: {.fragment}

## Inferior Goods - Graph Intuition

With an inferior good (let's keep saying $y$) there is a predictable shift when income increases

. . .

![](Images/Inferior-Good3.png){fig-align="center" height=500 width=600}

The new bundle must be in [this region of the budget]{.hi-purple}

---

## Can Both Goods Be Inferior?

As your income increases, can you buy less of both goods?

::: {.incremental}
- No! [Why Not?]{.h}
- The Budget Constraint does not allow it
- Recall that the BC looks like: $P_{x} \cdot x + P_{y} \cdot y = M$
:::

. . .

If your income increases, and you decrease the amount of $x$ you consume ($x$ is an inferior good), then there is a lot of income leftover that is required to be spent

The only other option is to increase your consumption of $y$

. . .

<br>

> In fact, if increasing your income has no effect on how much $x$ you consume, you would still have to increase your consumption of $y$

---

## Engel Curves

This curve describes the relationship between $M^{*}$ and $y^{*}$, with $M$ on the vertical axis and $y^{*}$ on the horizontal axis 

Let's build this by parts, starting with a bunch of income levels and the associated $y^{*}$ consumption levels 

. . .

![](Images/Engel-Curve1.png){fig-align="center" height=400 width=600}

[**Notice the axis!**]{.hi .align-center}

---

## Engel Curves

If we connect all our optimal levels of $y^{*}$ we find our [Engel Curve]{.hi}

## Engel Curves

The important thing to consider about Engel Curves is the [sign of the slope]{.h} $\rightarrow$ [It tells us if a good is normal or inferior]{.h}

::: {.incremental}
- A [Positive Slope]{.hi-green} means that when Income goes up, $y^{*}$ increases and we say $y$ is a [normal good]{.hi-green}
- A [Negative Slope]{.hp} means that when Income goes up, $y^{*}$ decreases and we say $y$ is an [inferior good]{.hp}
:::

. . .

<br>
We've seen that curves slopes can change, so we can ask ourselves:

> [Can a good be an inferior good over all income levels?]{.hi .note}

---

## Engel Curves - Inferior Goods Always?

[Can in be the case that no matter what my current income is, an increase in income will decrease my consumption of a good?]{.hi}

. . .

[It is impossible!]{.hi}

::: {.incremental}
- Even a good that is usually inferior, or better said, [inferior over common income levels must be a normal good over low enough levels of income]{.hii}
    - I'll show  you an example of an Engel Curve with a negative slope and we'll see why 
:::

---

## Engel Curves - Inferior Goods Always?

Think about our Instant Ramen example. When in college, the more money you have, the more you buy Instant Ramen (so it is a normal good). 

But once you graduate and get that promised pay increase from graduating, you buy Instant Ramen less and less the higher your Income becomes (inferior good)

## Engel Curves - Mathematically

We can formalize Engel Curves as:

::: {.incremental}
1. Engel Curves are graphs of the Demand Function
    - $x^{*} = f(P_{x},P_{y},M)$
2. Where we hold prices fixed and flip the axis
:::

---

## Engel Curves - Mathematically

Take our Cobb-Douglas example

$$U(x,y) = x^{\alpha}y^{\beta} \;\;\; \text{where} \;\;\; \alpha = \beta = P_{x} = 1$$

Also recall that

$$x^{*} = \dfrac{\alpha}{\alpha + \beta} \cdot \dfrac{M}{P_{x}}$$

. . .

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Solving for $M$ yields:

::: {.fragment}
\begin{align*}
    x^{*} &= \dfrac{\alpha}{\alpha + \beta} \cdot \dfrac{M}{P_{x}} \\
    x^{*} &= \dfrac{1}{2} \cdot M = \dfrac{M}{2} \\
    x^{*} &= \dfrac{M}{2} \rightarrow M = 2x^{*}
\end{align*}

::: {.column width="50%"}

What's the slope of this demand tell us?

::: {.fragment}
\begin{align*}
    \dfrac{\partial x}{\partial M} = \dfrac{1}{2} > 0
\end{align*}

## Engel Curves - Using Derivatives

We can show whether a good is normal or not over all income levels by taking the derivative with respect to $M$

<br><br>
$$\text{if} \;\; \dfrac{\partial x^{*}}{\partial M} > 0 \Rightarrow \text{Normal Good}$$

<br><br>

$$\text{if} \;\; \dfrac{\partial x^{*}}{\partial M} < 0 \Rightarrow \text{Inferior Good}$$

---

## Back to Income Changes

We just saw that we can find whether a good is a normal or inferior by taking the partial derivative of the demand function w.r.t. income 

- By knowing what category the good falls into, we can quickly estimate how demand will react to changes in income
- But this only tells us up or down, not magnitudes
<br>
- To find that, we will look at [elasticities]{.hi}

---

## Elasticities 

They tell us how responsive demand is to income changes (later we will see price changes)

They follow the formula:

$$E_{x^{*},M} = \dfrac{\partial x^{*}}{\partial M} \cdot \dfrac{M}{x^{*}}$$

. . .

There are 3 steps to finding an elasticity

::: {.incremental}
1. Take the partial derivative of the good w.r.t. $M$

2. Multiply the partial derivative by the ratio of the [input variable]{.hii} to the [response variable]{.hi}
    - [What is changing]{.hii} to [what we are estimating to chagne]{.hi}

3. Substitute the original demand equation and simplify
:::

---

## Elasticities - Example

Let the Demand for $x^{*}$ be:

$$x^{*} = \dfrac{M}{P_{x}}$$

> [1 - Take the partial derivative w.r.t. Income]{.h .note}

. . .

\begin{align*}
    \dfrac{\partial x}{\partial M} = \dfrac{1}{P_{x}}
\end{align*}

---

## Elasticities - Example

The partial derivative is:

$$\dfrac{\partial x}{\partial M} = \dfrac{1}{P_{x}}$$

> [2 - Multiply the partial derivative by the ratio of input variable to the response variable $\left(\dfrac{M}{x^{*}} \right)$]{.h .note}

. . . 

\begin{align*}
    E_{x^{*},M} = \dfrac{\partial x^{*}}{\partial M} \cdot \dfrac{M}{x^{*}} \rightarrow \dfrac{1}{P_{x}} \cdot \dfrac{M}{x^{*}}
\end{align*}

---

## Elasticities - Example 

$$
E_{x^{*},M} = \dfrac{\partial x^{*}}{\partial M} \cdot \dfrac{M}{x^{*}} \rightarrow \dfrac{1}{P_{x}} \cdot \dfrac{M}{x^{*}}
$$

> [3 - Substitute the original demand equation in and simplify]{.h .note}

. . .

\begin{align*}
    E_{x^{*},M} &= \dfrac{1}{P_{x}} \cdot \dfrac{M}{\color{red}{x}} = \dfrac{1}{P_{x}} \cdot \dfrac{M}{\color{red}{\dfrac{M}{P_{x}}}} = \dfrac{1}{P_{x}} \cdot P_{x} = \dfrac{P_{x}}{P_{x}} = 1
\end{align*}

. . .

So we would say that good $x$ has an Income Elasticity of 1

---

## Elasticities: What do They Mean?

They tell us how to translate a proportional change in $x$ into a proportional change in $y$

So for the elasticity 

$$E_{x,y} = \eta $$

<br>
If $y$ goes up by $10\%$, $x$ increases by $\eta \cdot 10\%$

Equivalently, if $y$ goes down by $20\%$, $x$ decreases by $\eta \cdot 20\%$

. . .

Elasticities can be

- Positive, negative, zero, or infinite

. . .

When considering Income Elasticities we know that 

- Normal goods have positive elasticities

- Inferior goods have negative elastiticies

---

## Elasticities: Responsiveness

We can describe how responsive goods are in terms of elasiticity

::: {.incremental}
- If the [**absolute value**]{.h .note} of an elasticity is [greater than 1 $(> 1)$]{.hi} we say that there is an [**elastic**]{.hi} response
    - $E_{x,M} = 2 \rightarrow M \uparrow 10\%, \; x \uparrow 20\%$

- If the [**absolute value**]{.h .note} of an elasticity is [less than 1 $(<1)$]{.hi} we say that there is an [**inelastic**]{.hi} response 
    - $E_{x,M} = 0.5 \rightarrow M \uparrow 10\%, \; x \uparrow 5\%$

- If the [**absolute value**]{.h .note} of an elasticity is [equal to 1 $(=1)$]{.hi} we say that the response is [**unit elastic**]{.hi}

- If the elastiscity is [exactly equal to 0]{.hi} we call this [**perfectly inelastic**]{.hi}

- If the elasticity is [infinite $(\infty)$]{.hi} we call this [**perfectly elastic**]{.hi}
