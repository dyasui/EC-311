## Price Changes are Important 

Changing the price of a good and seeing what changes that causes is one of the most important types of changes we can consider

- This is what people in the real world most want to know about

. . .

An important thing to have in mind throughout this section is:

- If you hear/read "Demand Curve" or "Elasticity" without specifying if it's about price or income, [**the default is Own-Price Elasticity**]{.h}

---

## Price Changes {.smaller}

Let's recall an important effect of price changes on the Budget Constraint

## Individual Demand 

Similar to the Engel Curve, we can connect these optimal bundles to get an important curve

. . .

![](Images/Price-Offer-Curve2.png){fig-align="center" width="500" height="400"}

This is an [Individual Demand Curve]{.hi}

## Individual Demand Curve

If we clean it up a bit, we get our typical [downward sloping Demand Curve]{.hi}

[Notice I changed the axis slightly: I put Price on the vertical axis and Quantity of $x$ demanded on the horizontal axis]{.hi}

## Income Changes (Again) {.smaller}

If you recall from EC 201 we learned about demand shifters when income increases.

If we repeat this exercise with an increased income we can observe the [Demand Shift]{.hi}

## Individual Demand (Mathematically) {.smaller}

As we have done before, we also show the [Demand Curve Properties]{.hi} through derivatives!

Let's show that the Demand Curve is downward sloping

. . .

- First, recall that the optimal consumption for a normal good $y$ from a Cobb-Douglas Utility Function is:

$$
    y^{*} = \dfrac{\beta}{\alpha + \beta} \cdot \dfrac{M}{P_{y}} = \dfrac{\beta M}{\alpha + \beta} \cdot P_{y}^{-1}
$$

. . .

- Second, we take the [derivative w.r.t. Price]{.hi}

$$
    \dfrac{\partial y}{\partial P_{y}} = \dfrac{\beta M}{\alpha + \beta} \cdot (-1)P_{y}^{-2} = \dfrac{-\beta M}{\alpha + \beta} \cdot P_{y}^{-2} = \dfrac{-\beta M}{\alpha + \beta} \cdot \dfrac{1}{P_{y}^{2}} < 0 
$$

::: {.notes}
C-D behaves as expected, the demand curve is downward sloping

## Price Elasticity

This concept is identical to income elasticity 

I will refer to the [Elasticity of Demand]{.hi} as the [elasticity of $x$ with respect to $P_{x}$]{.hi}

. . .

The formula is

$$
    E_{x^{*},P_{x}} = \dfrac{\partial x^{*}}{\partial P_{x}} \cdot \dfrac{P_{x}}{x^{*}} 
$$

---

## Elasticity of Demand - Example {.smaller}

Let 

$$
    E_{x^{*},P_{x}} = \dfrac{\partial x^{*}}{\partial P_{x}} \cdot \dfrac{P_{x}}{x^{*}}  \;\; \text{where} \;\; x^{*} = \dfrac{M}{2P_{x}}
$$

. . .

> [Find $\;\; \dfrac{\partial x^{*}}{\partial P_{x}}$]{.hi .note}

. . .

$$
    \dfrac{\partial x^{*}}{\partial P_{x}} = \dfrac{-M}{2P_{x}^{2}}
$$

. . .

> [Plug in our known values to the elasticity formula]{.hi .note}

. . .

$$
    E_{x^{*},P_{x}} = \dfrac{-M}{2P_{x}^{2}} \cdot \dfrac{P_{x}}{\color{red}{x}} = \dfrac{-M}{2P_{x}^{2}} \cdot \dfrac{P_{x}}{\color{red}{\dfrac{M}{2P_{x}}}} = \dfrac{-P_{x}}{P_{x}} = -1
$$

---

## Elasticity of Demand - Example 2 {.smaller}

$$
    y^{*} = \dfrac{20}{P_{y}} - 10
$$

. . .

> [Find $\;\; \dfrac{\partial y^{*}}{\partial P_{y}}$]{.hi .note}

. . .

$$
    \dfrac{\partial y^{*}}{\partial P_{y}} = \dfrac{-20}{P_{y}^{2}}
$$

> [Plug in our known values to the elasticity formula]{.hi .note}

. . .

$$
    E_{y^{*}, P_{y}} = \dfrac{-20}{20 - 10 P_{y}}
$$

---

## Elasticity Results

$$
    E_{y^{*}, P_{y}} = \dfrac{-20}{20 - 10 P_{y}}
$$

We will allow elasticities to look like functions, with some restrictions:

- The Elasticity is [allowed]{.hi} to depend on the [input variable]{.hi}

    - $P_{y}$ in our current example

- The Elasticity [never depends]{.hi} on the [response variable]{.hi}

    - $y^{*}$ in the current example

---

## Income Change Example

Let's put it all together. Given 

$$
    U(x,y) = 12 \cdot ln(x) + y
$$

- Find $x^{*}$ and $y^{*}$

- Draw a graph on the $(x,y)$ plane with 3 ICs and the respective utility maximizing budget constraint

- Draw Engel Curves for both $x^{*}$ and $y^{*}$ 

    - Find the Function, I'll guide us through the graphing

- Use the derivatives with respect to income for both $x^{*}$ and $y^{*}$ and classify the type of good (Normal or Inferior)

- Find the Elasticities of Demand with respect to income for both $x^{*}$ and $y^{*}$ and classify them (Elastic, Inelastic, etc)

---

## Find $x^{*}$ and $y^{*}$ 

$$
    U(x,y) = 12 \cdot ln(x) + y \;\;\;\; \text{subject to} \;\;\;\; P_{x} \cdot x + P_{y} \cdot y = M
$$

## Changes in Quantity Demanded 

There are two major driving factors in changes in quantity when price changes: 

::: {.incremental}
1. Change that results from a change in the relative price of the two goods $\rightarrow$ [Substitution Effect]{.hi}
2. Change that results from a change in the purchasing power of the consumer's income $\rightarrow$ [Income Effect]{.hi} 
:::

. . .

However, we [**cannot**]{.hi-red} observe both of these in the real world 

We observed the [**combined**]{.hi-teal} effect of these two 

So we have:

. . .

$$
    \text{Total Effect} = \text{Substitution Effect} + \text{Income Effect}
$$
