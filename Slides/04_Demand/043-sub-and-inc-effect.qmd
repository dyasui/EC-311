## Substitution effect {.smaller}

It is the change in bundle resulting from a change in the relative price of two goods

[The relative price of both goods is simply the slope of the Budget Constraint]{.hi} 

::: {.incremental}
- Suppose that $P_{y}$ decreases by some $\epsilon$ so that $\hat{P_{y}} = P_{y} - \epsilon$

    - How would this change the Budget Constraint?

    - $\text{Slope: } \dfrac{-P_{x}}{P_{y}} \;\; \rightarrow \;\;\downarrow P_{y} \;\; \rightarrow \;\; \text{Slope gets Steeper}$

> The goal is to find where the consumer [**does not**]{.h} feel wealthier or poorer given the change in relative prices

## Substitution Effect

> [We want to find where the consumer feels **indifferent** after price changes?]{.hi .note}

- We need to find a bundle on the same [**Indifference Curve**]{.hi} but using a new Budget Constraint

. . .

## Income Effect {.smaller  }

It is the change in bundle resulting from a change in the purchasing power of the consumer's income 

- The relative income (purchasing power) can change even when income does not

. . .

## Substitution and Income Effect Summary

The [Substitution Effect]{.hi-teal} is the effect of changing the slope of the budget line [without changing the indifference curve you started on]{.hi-teal}

The [Income Effect]{.hi-purple} is the difference between the [Substitution Effect]{.hi-teal} and the [new utility maximizing point]{.hi-purple}
