name: individual demand and market demand

## Up to Now

All the work we have done until now has been to understand and characterize where demand for a good comes from at an [individual level]{.h} 

. . .

<br>

But now, we want to talk about how [markets behave and where prices come from]{.hi} 

<br>

To do so, we need a measure of [Aggregate or Market Demand]{.hi}

---

## Market Demand

We will begin by assuming the following demand function for [ONE]{.hi} consumer in a market

$$
    x^{*} = f(P_{x},M) = M - P_{x}
$$

. . .

If I said that this market was made up of 2 consumers with [identical utility functions]{.hi} and incomes how can I get market demand?

. . .

- Add them up

::: {.fragment}
- Market Demand $(Q_{D})$ is the [sum]{.hi} of all individual demands

$$
    Q_{D} = x^{*} + x^{*} = 2x^{*} \; \rightarrow \; 2(M - P_{x}) = 2M - 2P_{x}
$$
