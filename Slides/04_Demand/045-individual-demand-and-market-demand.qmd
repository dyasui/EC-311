name: individual demand and market demand

## Up to Now

All the work we have done until now has been to understand and characterize where demand for a good comes from at an [individual level]{.h} 

. . .

<br>

But now, we want to talk about how [markets behave and where prices come from]{.hi} 

<br>

To do so, we need a measure of [Aggregate or Market Demand]{.hi}

---

## Market Demand

We will begin by assuming the following demand function for [ONE]{.hi} consumer in a market

$$
    x^{*} = f(P_{x},M) = M - P_{x}
$$

. . .

If I said that this market was made up of 2 consumers with [identical utility functions]{.hi} and incomes how can I get market demand?

. . .

- Add them up

::: {.fragment}
- Market Demand $(Q_{D})$ is the [sum]{.hi} of all individual demands

$$
    Q_{D} = x^{*} + x^{*} = 2x^{*} \; \rightarrow \; 2(M - P_{x}) = 2M - 2P_{x}
$$

## Let's Make It More Complicated

We will call our 2 agents Jose and Maria

Now we will assume the same demand $x^{*} = M - P_{x}$ but they have different incomes $(M)$:

- Jose has $M = 6$

- Maria has $M = 10$

It is still the case that market demand is the sum of both individuals

. . .

$$
    Q_{D} = x^{*}_{J} + x^{*}_{M} = 10 - P_{x} + 6 - P_{x} = 16 - 2P_{x}
$$

[But there is an issue here!]{.hp .align-center}

::: {.notes}
What is it? 

Once $P_{x} \geq 6$, Jose demands 0 and only Maria is left in the market

## Market Demand

Whenever you add up [linear demand curves]{.h} across individuals with [different $P_{x}$ intercepts]{.h} in the demand curves, you will get a small kink in the market demand function

. . .

## Market Demand - Example 2

Let there be 2 agents with the following utilities 

$$
U_{a} = ln(x) + y \;\;\;\; \& \;\;\;\; U_{b} = 2ln(x) + y \;\;\; ; \;\;\; P_{y} = 1
$$

> [Find the market demand curve (Hint: Find $x_{a}^{*}$ and $x_{b}^{*}$)]{.h .note}

. . .

\begin{align*}
    x_{a}^{*} &\; : \; MRS = \dfrac{P_{x}}{P_{y}} \; \rightarrow \; \dfrac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}} = \dfrac{P_{x}}{1} \; \rightarrow \; \dfrac{1}{x^{*}_{a}} = P_{x} \; \rightarrow \; x^{*}_{a} = \dfrac{1}{P_{x}} \\ 
    x_{b}^{*} &\; : \; MRS = \dfrac{P_{x}}{P_{y}} \; \rightarrow \; \dfrac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}} = \dfrac{P_{x}}{1} \; \rightarrow \; \dfrac{2}{x^{*}_{b}} = P_{x} \; \rightarrow \; x^{*}_{b} = \dfrac{2}{P_{x}}
\end{align*}

. . .

\begin{align*}
    Q_{D} &\; : \; x^{*}_{a} + x^{*}_{b} = \dfrac{1}{P_{x}} + \dfrac{2}{P_{x}} = \dfrac{3}{P_{x}} \; \rightarrow \; Q_{D} = \dfrac{3}{P_{x}} \; \rightarrow \; P_{x} = \dfrac{3}{Q_{D}}
\end{align*}

## Consumer Theory

All we have seen up to now is the basics of [Consumer Theory]{.hi} 

A quick example of an application can be:

::: {.incremental}
- Let's say you are interested in the demand for energy drinks
- You build utility functions for a couple different groups in the market that you believe represent their preferences for energy drinks and other consumption
- You solve the maximization problem and understand how the optimal solutions change when inputs change
- Then you add up the solutions across groups in the market to measure the relationsihp between price and demand
