## Profits and Market Feedback

Firms entering or exiting the market has a really important feedback effect

Do your best to recall from EC 201:

[When the number of firms in an industry increases, what effect does this have on the market price?]{.hi .note .align-center}

. . .

::: {.column width="50%"}

## Long-Run Feedback Effect

The feedback has predictable outcomes that we can organize in our minds

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
[$P > \min\{ATC(Q)\}$]{.hi .align-center}

::: {.incremental .tiny}
1. In the [Short-Run]{.hi}, firms in the market make [positive economic profits]{.hi-green}
2. In the [Long-Run]{.hi}, new firms enter the market
3. The market now has [more]{.hi-green} firms, which means there is [more quantity]{.hi-green} produced
4. This repeats until 
:::

::: {.fragment}
$$
    P = \min\{ATC(Q)\}
$$
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
[$P < \min\{ATC(Q)\}$]{.hi .align-center}

::: {.incremental .tiny}
1. In the [Short-Run]{.hi}, firms in the market make [negative economic profits]{.hi-red}
2. In the [Long-Run]{.hi}, firms exit the market
3. The market now has [less]{.hi-red} firms, which means there is [less quantity]{.hi-red} produced
4. This repeats until
:::

::: {.fragment}
$$
    P = \min\{ATC(Q)\}
$$

## Long-Run Outcomes

No matter what price is initially, in the [Long-Run]{.hi} we will always return to 

$$
    P = \min\{ATC(Q)\}
$$

. . .

[How do shifts in quantity affect market prices?]{.hi .note .align-center}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
[Negative Profits]{.hi-red .align-center}

::: {.fragment}
- With a decrease in quantity, market prices climb with each firm that leaves until we return to [zero-profits]{.hi}
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
[Positive Profits]{.hi-green .align-center}

::: {.fragment}
- With an increase in quantity, market prices decrease with each entering firm until we return to [zero-profits]{.hi}
:::

:::

## Long-Run Outcomes

So if prices in the [Long-Run]{.hi} will always be

$$
    P = \min\{ATC(Q)\}
$$

[What does this imply about profits in the Long-Run]{.hi .align-center}

. . .

<br>
[There are no economic profits in the Long-Run!]{.hi .align-center}

<br><br>
[But let's be careful with interpreting what this means]{.align-center}

---

## Profits in the Long-Run

Saying there are zero economic profits can be a tricky phrase so let's dive in:

::: {.incremental}
- It does not mean that the firm is making zero money
- They have already paid their [Labor (wages)]{.hi} and [Capital (or shareholders if they financed capital through equity, for example)]{.hi}
- After all responsibilities are dealt with, there are zero profits above and beyond that
:::

---

## Why Care About the Short-Run?

If we know what happens in the [Long-Run]{.hi}, then why care about the [Short-Run]{.hi}?

. . .

[The Short-Run is where interesting things happen]{.hi .align-center}

::: {.incremental}
- It is where firms make big money, before competitors can catch up (Think early Tesla days and the EV market)
- It is where firms lose a lot of money because they are stuck operating at a loss (any restaurant ever)
- [It is where demand shifts can cause major price distortions]{.hi}
    - This is an interesting dynamic that we will use to transition to thinking about the market
:::

---

## Demand Shift Dynamics

Let's imagine the following market:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%" .tiny}
- The [Short-Run]{.hi} market supply curve is $P = Q_{S} + 10$ when $P > 10$

<br>

- Assume that $\min\{ATC(Q)\} = 25$

<br>

- The demand curve is $P = 40 - Q_{D}$
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}

::: {.fragment}
![](images/demand-shift-example-1.png){fig-align="center"}
:::
:::

::::

---

## Demand Shift Dynamics

Because initial price of 25 is equal to $\min\{ ATC(Q) \}$ and there are no profits

- The market is in its [Long-Run Equilibrium]{.hi} 

. . .

- Now imagine that this product gets much more popular 

    - What do we expect to happen with [Demand]{.hi}?

. . . 

[It should shift to the right (increases)]{.hi .align-center}

---

## Demand Shift Dynamics - Product Got More Popular

![](images/demand-shift-example-2.png){fig-align="center"}

---

## Demand Shift Dynamics

With an increase in [Demand]{.hi}, we see that prices have also increased

::: {.incremental}
- In the [Short-Run]{.hi}, the [same number of firms produce more and earn positive profits]{.h}
- In the [Long-Run]{.hi}, [new firms enter the market]{.hi-green}
    - This increases supply
:::

---

## Demand Shift Dynamics - Entry of New Firms

![](images/demand-shift-example-3.png){fig-align="center"}

---

## Demand Shift Dynamics

With a Supply increase:

::: {.incremental}
- The shift of supply [counteracts]{.hi} the increase in Demand and the price returns to $\min\{ATC(Q)\}$
- However, a lot more good are supplied overall
    - In the [Long-Run]{.hi}, each firm is supplying the same amount at $Q_{3}$ as they were in the initial equilibrium
- There are just more firms now
:::

---

## Long-Run Market Supply Curve

We can graph the Supply Curve in the [Long-Run]{.hi}

It is simply a flat line at $P = \min\{ATC(Q)\}$ 

- The quantity (and the number of firms in the market) is determined by [Demand]{.hi}

## Long-Run Market Supply Curve

![](images/long-run-supply-curve.png){fig-align="center"}

---

## Let's Look at an Example

In this example we will:

::: {.incremental}
- Find the [Short-Run]{.hi} supply cure of the firm
- Find the market [Short-Run Supply Curve]{.hi} when there are 20 identical firms
- Find the market [Long-Run Supply Curve]{.hi} 
- Graph both market supply curves, add demand and quantity, assuming the [Long-Run Equilibrium]{.hi}

The Cost Function of a firm is

$$
    C(Q) = Q^{2} + 8Q + 100
$$

---

## Short-Run Supply Curve

$$
    C(Q) = Q^{2} + 8Q + 100
$$

[Short-Run Supply is $\; P = MC$]{.hi .note .align-center}

. . .

\begin{align*}
    MC = \frac{\partial C(Q)}{\partial Q} = 2Q + 8
\end{align*}

[Set P = MC]{.hi .align-center .note}

\begin{align*}
    P = 2Q + 8
\end{align*}

## Market Short-Run Supply Curve with 20 Identical Firms {.smaller}

$$
    P = 2Q + 8
$$

    P &= 2Q + 8 \\
    2Q &= P - 8 \\

[Market Supply Function will be $\; N \cdot Q = Q_{S}$]{.hi .align-center}

::: {.fragment .tiny}
\begin{align*}
    Q_{S} &= N \cdot Q \\
    Q_{S} &= 20 \cdot \left( \frac{P - 8}{2} \right) \\
    Q_{S} &= 10P - 80
\end{align*}

[Market Supply Curve Is:]{.hi .align-center}

    Q_{S} &= 10P - 80 \\
    10P &= Q_{S} + 80 \\

## Market Long-Run Supply Curve
