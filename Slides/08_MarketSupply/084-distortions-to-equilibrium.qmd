## Market Shocks Create Distortions

We just saw how shocks to the market distort both the [Short-Run & Long-Run]{.hi} 

The [Long-Run]{.hi} is very robust and is not really impacted by price shocks. But is this always the case? 

. . .

[When will distortions to equilibrium affect the Long-Run Equilibrium Price?]{.hi .align-center}

. . .

To answer that, we remember what determines the [Long-Run Price]{.hi}

::: {.fragment}
- Minimum Average Total Cost
:::

::: {.fragment}
[So a shock will only affect the Long-Run Price if it impacts the Minimum Average Total Cost]{.hi .note .align-center}

## Distortion Example - Oil Industry

What effect will the invention of more [fuel-efficient cars]{.h} have on the price of oil?

. . . 

[None!]{.hi-red} This is a shock to demand and thus the [minimum ATC]{.hi} is unaffected

. . . 

What effect will the invention of more [fuel-efficient cars]{.h} have generally?
