## Market Shocks Create Distortions

We just saw how shocks to the market distort both the [Short-Run & Long-Run]{.hi} 

The [Long-Run]{.hi} is very robust and is not really impacted by price shocks. But is this always the case? 

. . .

[When will distortions to equilibrium affect the Long-Run Equilibrium Price?]{.hi .align-center}

. . .

To answer that, we remember what determines the [Long-Run Price]{.hi}

::: {.fragment}
- Minimum Average Total Cost
:::

::: {.fragment}
[So a shock will only affect the Long-Run Price if it impacts the Minimum Average Total Cost]{.hi .note .align-center}
:::

## Distortion Example - Oil Industry

What effect will the invention of more [fuel-efficient cars]{.h} have on the price of oil?

. . . 

[None!]{.hi-red} This is a shock to demand and thus the [minimum ATC]{.hi} is unaffected

. . . 

What effect will the invention of more [fuel-efficient cars]{.h} have generally?

::: {.incremental}
- We will see a [decrease]{.hi-red} in price and quantity in the [Short-Run]{.hi}
- Firms in the oil industry will make [negative profits]{.hi-red}
- Firms will begin to leave the industry
- The [Supply Curve]{.hi} shifts to the left and re-establishes the [Long-Run Price]{.hi} with a lower quantity produced

## Distortion Example - Oil Industry

What effect will the invention of [more efficient drilling technology]{.hi} have on the [Long-Run Price]{.hi} of oil?

::: {.incremental}
- This should lower the [Long-Run Price]{.hi}. Why?
    - Because this should lower the [Average Total Cost]{.h}
- This will increase quantity supplied and decrease the market price

## Distortions to Equilibrium

One very specific type of cost change that we want to consider is [Taxation]{.hi-red}

. . .

We will deal with two types of taxes:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

<br><br><br>
[LUMP-SUM TAXES]{.hi .big .align-center}

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

<br><br><br>
[PER-UNIT TAXES]{.hi .big .align-center}

:::

::::

## Lump-Sum Taxes

Under this [tax structure]{.hi} firms have to pay a [One-Time Fee]{.hi-orange} to participate in the market

::: {.incremental}
- Think licenses, permits, inspections, etc.
- These will affect a firm's fixed costs
    - Increasing fixed costs will increase the [Minimum ATC]{.hi}
    - Decreasing fixed costs will decrease the [Minumum ATC]{.hi}
:::

---

## Lump-Sum Taxes

[These form of taxes will NOT affect the firm's Marginal Costs]{.hi .align-center}

. . .

[The Short-Run Supply Curve is completely unnafected]{.hi .align-center}

::: {.incremental}
- Imposing a [Lump-sum Tax]{.hi-orange} will have no [Short-Run Effect]{.hi}
- In the [Long-Run]{.hi}, firms will leave the industry as it converges to its new [Long-Run Equilibrium]{.hi}
:::

. . .

<br> 

[Let's look at a brief example]{.hi .align-center}

---

## Per-Unit Taxes {.smaller}

These will affect the firm's marginal costs [DIRECTLY]{.hi}

. . .

Take for example the following firm:

$$
    C(Q) = Q^{2} + Q + 20
$$

Where [Marginal Costs]{.hi} are:

$$
    MC(Q) = 2Q + 1
$$

. . .

Let's impose the per-unit tax $\tau$ such that the cost function becomes:

$$
    C(Q) = Q^{2} + Q + 20 + \color{red}{\tau \cdot Q}
$$

[What is the Marginal Cost after Taxes?]{.hi .note .align-center}

. . .

$$
    MC = 2Q + 1 + \tau 
$$

## Per-Unit Taxes

![](images/per-unit-tax-1.png){fig-align="center"}

---

## Per-Unit Taxes

![](images/per-unit-tax-2.png){fig-align="center"}

---

## Per-Unit Taxes

The [Marginal Cost (and then the Supply Curve)]{.hi} is shifted up by the exact amount of the tax, so:

::: {.incremental}
- The [New Price $\; (P_{\tau}^{*}) \;$]{.hi} is the price that consumers pay to the firm 
- The [New Price $\; (P_{\tau}^{*}) \;$ minus the tax]{.hi} is the price received by the producers [after they pay the tax]{.hi-red}
- So even though the shift in the [Supply Curve]{.hi} looks like it increased the price, [it brings down the price earned by the firm]{.hi-red}  
:::

---

## Per-Unit Taxes

<br><br><br>

In the [Long-Run]{.hi}, firms will leave the market because the [tax induced losses]{.hi-red}

The [Long-Run Equilibrium Price]{.hi} is at exactly the original price, plus the tax

---

## Per-Unit Taxes

![](images/per-unit-tax-3.png){fig-align="center"}

---

## Per-Unit Taxes {.smaller}

Why will the effect on the [Long-Run Price]{.hi} be exactly the size of the tax?

[Because it will be the case that the minimum ATC increased by exactly the tax $\, (\tau)$]{.hi}

. . .

For the [Cost Function]{.hi}

$$
    C(Q) = Q^{2} + 9 + \tau Q
$$

We have: 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
[Average Total Cost]{.hi .align-center}

::: {.fragment}
\begin{align*}
    ATC &= Q + \frac{9}{Q} + \tau
\end{align*}
:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.fragment}
[Marginal Cost]{.hi .align-center}

\begin{align*}
    MC &= 2Q + \tau 
\end{align*}
:::

:::

::::

. . .

[We set them equal to each other & the tax cancels out]{.hi .align-center}

\begin{align*}
    ATC &= MC \\
    Q + \frac{9}{Q} + \color{red}{\tau} &= 2Q + \color{red}{\tau}
\end{align*}

---

## Per-Unit Taxes {.smaller}

- So the [New Long-Run Price]{.hi} is exactly the old [Long-Run Price + the Per-Unit Tax]{.hi}

We see this in the previous example:

$$
    ATC = Q + \frac{9}{Q} + \tau
$$

. . . 

- Firms receive the same price per unit. We saw that the tax cancels out

\begin{align*}
    ATC &= MC \\
    Q + \frac{9}{Q} + \color{red}{\tau} &= 2Q + \color{red}{\tau}
\end{align*}

. . . 

- Overall quantity in the market is lower because there are fewer firms
