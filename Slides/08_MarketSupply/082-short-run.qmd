## Short-Run Supply

Previously, we graphed the supply curve to include the firm's [shut-down decision]{.hi}:

![](./images/new-supply-curve.png)

. . .

Because the firm has to either produce something or nothing in the short term, this is the [Short-Run Supply Curve]{.hi}

---

## Short-Run vs Long-Run Supply

- This is the [short-run]{.h} because the firm can't operate on the margin of their [fixed costs]{.hi}

    - Eventually firms can [enter]{.hi-green} by choosing to paying the startup costs
    - or [exit]{.hi-red} the market by recouping their fixed costs

---

## What Affects Short-Term Supply?

What could change how much **quantity** firms are willing to produce in the [short-run]{.hi}?

::: {.incremental}

Anything that affects their [marginal costs]{.h}!

- Technology (more productive inputs $\downarrow$ MC $\rightarrow$ $\uparrow Q^s$)

- Input prices (more expensive labor $\uparrow MC \rightarrow \downarrow Q^s$
:::

## What Does Not Affect Short-Term Supply?

Any [fixed costs]{.hi} have to be treated as *sunk costs* in the short run, and do factor into MC

::: {.incremental}
This includes:

- Factory space

- Contracted costs (annual, multi-year, etc.)

- R&D costs
:::

---

## Producer Surplus

In the short run, a firm can earn a [markup]{.hi} over their costs.

Another way of measuring this markup is the [producer surplus]{.hi}

$$PS = TR - VC$$

- How much more does the firm gain in revenue compared to its costs

---

## Producer Surplus

What does it look like?

## Firm Supply -> Market Supply

A single firm $i$'s supply decision: pick $q_i$ quantity to maximize profit

$$ MC_i(q_i) \bigg\rvert_{q_i\geq 0} = MR_i = P$$

::: {.incremental}

- $MC_i$ is firm $i$'s supply curve, or [willingness to sell]{.hi}

- If we wanted the [supply function]{.hi} we could rerrange: $q_i^S = MC_i^{-1}(P)$

:::

---

## Firm Supply -> Market Supply

An example:

$$ MC_i(q_i) = q_i^2 -20q_i +100 $$

::: {.incremental}

- Can be rewritten as $MC = (q_i - 10)^2$

- $q_i^S = MC_i^{-1}(P) = \sqrt{P} + 10$

:::

## Market Supply

We will label [Market Supply]{.hi} as $Q^{S}$

And it is obtained in the exact same way as market demand 

. . .

- If you know the $q_i^S$ of one firm, and there are 10 identical firms, then we get

$$
    Q^{S} = 10 \cdot q_i^S
$$

---

## Market Supply Example

Consider up to 10 firms all with $MC=q_i^2 - 20q + 100$

- Then $Q^S = 10 \cdot (\sqrt{P} +10)$

## Market Supply

If each firm has a different marginal cost function:

- (and thers are $N$ number of firms)

$$Q^S = \sum_{i=1}^N q_i^S$$

---

## Producer Surplus vs Profit

<u>Producer Surplus</u>:

$$PS = TR - VC$$

<u>Profit</u>:

$$\pi = TR - VC - FC$$

- The difference is [fixed costs]{.hi}

## Long-Run Market Supply

[What could determine whether a firm enters or exists the market?]{.hi .note .align-center}

. . .

[Producer Surplus]{.hi .align-center}

::: {.incremental}
- A firm may operate with negative profit
    - they will operate at a loss as long as it is less than their Fixed Costs
- But they won't operate with negative [producer surplus]{.hi}
    - because that means it costs more to produce each unit than it sells for
::: 

. . .

[In either case, the fact that profits are not zero has implications for the Long-Run]{.hi .align-center}

## Short-Run to Long-Run: Exit Condition

$$
PS < 0
$$

. . .

- AKA $TR < VC$, or $P < min \{ ATC \}$
