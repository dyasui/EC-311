## Market Supply

We will label [Market Supply]{.hi} as $Q_{S}$

And it is obtained in the exact same way as market demand 

. . .

- If you know the $Q^{*}$ of one firm, and there are 10 identical firms, then we get

$$
    Q_{S} = 10 \cdot Q^{*}
$$

. . .

But finding market supply is not as interesting as the dynamics between the [Short-Run & Long-Run]{.hi}
