## When Do Firm's Make Zero Profit?

The Perfectly Competitively firm will make [Zero Profit]{.hi-orange} when
$$
    P = ATC(Q^{*})
$$

How does this work, let's multiply both sides by $Q$

\begin{align*}
    P \cdot Q &= ATC(Q^{*}) \cdot Q \\
    \text{Revenue} &= \text{Cost}
\end{align*}

[We call this the]{.align-center}

[Zero-Profit Condition]{.align-center .hi}

## Zero-Profit Condition Equalities

From all the work we've done so far, we know that this point is the intersection of many different things

::: {.incremental}
- We begin with $P = ATC(Q^{*})$
- Recall we found that $P = MC(Q^{*})$ at that intersection
$$
    P = ATC(Q^{*}) = MC(Q^{*})
$$
- Lastly, remember that the [Marginal Cost Curve]{.hi} and the [Average Cost Curve]{.hi} cross at the [minimum of the ATC Curve]{.hi}
$$
    P = ATC(Q^{*}) = MC(Q^{*}) = \min\{ATC(Q^{*})\} 
$$

## Zero-Profit Condition

$$
    P = ATC(Q^{*}) = MC(Q^{*}) = \min\{ATC(Q^{*})\} 
$$

This is our [Zero-Profit Condition]{.hi}

. . .

If [Price]{.hi} is equal to the [Marginal Cost]{.hi} at the point where [Marginal Cost is equal to Average Total Cost]{.hi}, then it must also be the point where the [Average Total Cost]{.hi} is at its minimum
