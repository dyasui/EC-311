## Finding the Firm's Supply Function {.smaller}

Recall that we have assumed that a Perfectly Competitive firm cannot set its price 

- It does not have the power to do so in the market
    - To be more exact, any changes it makes does not affect the market equilibrium

- So because the firm just looks at the market price $(P)$ and chooses how much to produce, we will model supply as a function of price

- Let's continue to use our previous firm as an example, but we will leave Price as a variable:

. . . 

$$
    \pi(Q) = P \cdot Q - C(Q) = P \cdot Q - Q^{2} - 4Q - 20
$$

\end{align*}

## Finding Supply

So our [Supply Function]{.hi} will look like 

$$
    Q^{*} = f(P)
$$

This tells us how much a firm will produce as a function of the price

We can also find the [Supply Curve]{.hi}

. . .

This will be what we are able to graph, where [$P$]{.hi} will be on the y-axis

$$
    P = f(Q^{*})
$$

We have now created a [Supply Curve]{.hi} that is in the same format as our Demand Curve

## Let's See It Graphically {.smaller}

For the [Cost Function]{.hi}

$$
    C(Q) = \frac{1}{2}Q^{2} + 10Q + 10
$$

## Where is Supply?

Let's put it all together

![](images/supply-costs-together.png){fig-align="center"}

---

## Where is Supply?

Okay, so there wasn't an explicit [Supply Curve]{.hi} 

But it is there, we just have to polish it up a bit

Lets add some prices and map out the corresponding optimal quantities

. . .

Using $P = MC$ where $MC = Q + 10$ and $P = 20 , 25 , 30$ the optimal quantities are:
$$
    P = MC 
$$

\begin{align*}
    20 &= Q + 10 \rightarrow Q = 10 \\
    25 &= Q + 10 \rightarrow Q = 15 \\
    30 &= Q + 10 \rightarrow Q = 20 
\end{align*}

## Finding Profit from a Graph

We can also use this graph to find a firm's profits

We will do this in steps:

::: {.incremental}
- Find revenue (Recall $\text{Revenue} = P \cdot Q$)
- Find the firm's total cost using Average Total Costs
- Use the fact that profit is just the difference between Revenue and Cost
:::

## 1- Finding Revenue

[Assume that $\; P = 30 \;$ in this market]{.align-center} 

[We know that at $\; P = 30 \;$ we have $\; Q = 20\;$]{.align-center}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%"}
<br><br><br>
\begin{align*} 
    \text{Revenue} &= P \cdot Q \\
    \text{Revenue} &= 30 \cdot 20 \\
    \text{Revenue} &= 600
\end{align*}

## 2 - Finding Costs (Using ATC from Graph) {.smaller}

[Because we do not graph Costs we will use the ATC to find total costs]{.align-center}
[To find Total Costs, first recall how we found ATC]{.align-center}
\begin{align*}
    ATC = \frac{C(Q)}{Q} \;\; \Rightarrow \;\; C(Q) = ATC \cdot Q
\end{align*}

. . .

[Our Average Total Costs are $\; ATC = \frac{1}{2}Q + 10Q + \frac{10}{Q}$]{.align-center}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="35%"}

[\begin{align*}
    C(Q) &= ATC \cdot Q \\
    C(Q) &= Q \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}Q + 10 + \frac{10}{Q}\right) \\
    C(Q) &= \frac{1}{2}Q^{2} + 10Q + 10 \\
    C(20) &= \frac{1}{2}(20)^{2} + 10(20) + 10
\end{align*}]{.sub}

$$
    \text{Costs} = 410

## Finding Profit

[Profit will simply be the difference between these two boxes]{.hi .align-center}

## Finding Profit

Something imoprtant that we have already mentioned is tha profits can be [Positive]{.hi-green}, [Negative]{.hi-red}, or [Zero]{.hi-orange}

In math terms, this is determined if:

::: {.incremental}
- When $P > ATC$, the firm has [Positive Profits]{.hi-green}
- When $P < ATC$, the firm has [Negative Profits]{.hi-red}
- When $P = ATC$, the firm has [Zero Profits]{.hi-orange}
:::

## Why Would a Firm Ever Want Zero Profits?

We are thinking about [Economic Profits]{.hi}

- Remember this means that we care about [Opportunity Costs]{.hi}

- What this implies is that firms will squeeze their productivity as much as possible

. . .

This is a concept that trips up many non-economist minded folk so its worth expanding on:

\begin{align*}
    \text{Accounting Profits} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Accounting Costs}
\end{align*}

[Firms want their Accounting Profits to be positive, its how firms stay in business]{.hi .align-center}

---

## Pushing Economic Profits Down to Zero

\begin{align*}
    \text{Accounting Profits} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Accounting Costs} > 0 \rightarrow \; :)
\end{align*}

[Now let's compare this to Economic Profits]{.hi .align-center}

. . .

\begin{align*}
    \text{Economic Profits} = \text{Revenue} - \left(\text{Accounting Costs} + \text{Opportunity Costs}\right)
\end{align*}

- Opportunity Costs will push [Economic Profits]{.hi} down as much as possible
    - This means that the firm will be making their best possible choice

. . .

[Because firms do not want to be in the negative, their maximum Economic Profits will be equal to zero]{.hi .note .align-center .big}
