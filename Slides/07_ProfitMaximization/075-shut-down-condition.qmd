## Negative Profits

How can we tell whether a firm should produce or shut down?

::: {.incremental}
- The [Average Total Cost]{.hi} tells us whether a firm makes profits or losses
    - $P = ATC$ means that $P \cdot Q = ATC(Q^{*}) = C(Q^{*})$

- The [Average Variable Cost]{.hi} tells us whether a firm makes profits or losses, [ignoring fixed costs]{.hi}
    - $P = AVC$ means that $P \cdot Q = AVC(Q^{*}) \cdot Q = VC(Q^{*})$
:::

. . .

<br>

If $P = AVC(Q^{*}) \rightarrow$ [The firm makes no gains from producing!]{.hi}

## When Do Firms Shut Down? 

If $\text{Revenue} < VC(Q^{*})$, then profits will be less than $-FC$

Let's look at the intuition behind this:

::: {.incremental .small}
- The firm is making so little revenue, that it is making negative profits
- If this is true, then the firm is not making enough to even cover their [Fixed Costs]{.hi}. 
    - The firm cannot even afford to pay their monthly warehouse costs
- Then it can't pay their labor, can't afford their storefront
- Why keep going?
::: 

. . .

[It doesn't. This is when the firm shuts down, takes their ball and goes home]{.hi .align-center}

$$
    \text{Shutdown Condition: } P < AVC(Q^{*})
$$

## Perfectly Competitive Firm Shutdown Condition

We have the following conditions:

::: {.incremental}
- If $P = AVC(Q^{*})$, the [firm is indifferent between producing and shutting down]{.hi}
- If $P < AVC(Q^{*})$, the [firm shuts down]{.hi}
- If $P > AVC(Q^{*})$, the [firm will produce]{.hi}
:::

. . .

Recall that [MC = AVC at min{AVC}]{.hi} so it is equivalent to say:

::: {.fragment}
- $P = \min\{AVC\} \rightarrow$ [firm is indifferent]{.hi}
- $P < \min\{AVC\} \rightarrow$ [firm shuts down]{.hi}
- $P > \min\{AVC\} \rightarrow$ [firm produces]{.hi}
:::

## Two Important Conditions

So we have two important conditions that determine things about firms:

<br>
[Zero-Profit Condition]{.hi .align-center}

::: {.fragment}
$$
    P = ATC(Q^{*}) \;\;\; \text{or} \;\;\; P = \min\{ATC(Q^{*}) \}
$$
:::

<br>    
[Shut-Down Condition]{.hi .align-center}

::: {.fragment}
$$
    P < AVC(Q^{*}) \;\;\; \text{or} \;\;\; P < \min\{AVC(Q^{*}) \}
$$

## Effects on the Supply Curve

The [Shut-Down Condition]{.hi} will impact what the [Supply Curve]{.hi} looks like

::: {.incremental}
- Because the firm will shut down if $P < \min\{AVC\}$, we need to adjust our [Supply Curve]{.hi}
- Remember we found that the [Supply Curve was the Marginal Cost Curve]{.hi}
- This is still true, but we are adding our [Shut-Down Condition]{.hi}

## Supply Curve With Shut-Down Condition

## "New" Supply Curve

The [Supply Curve]{.hi} will follow:

\begin{equation*}
\text{Supply Curve} = 
    \begin{cases}
        P = MC(Q^{*}) &\text{if} \;\;\; P \geq \min\{AVC(Q^{*})\} \\ \\
        Q = 0 &\text{if} \;\;\;  P < \min\{AVC(Q^{*})\} 
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

. . .

<br><br>
We call this the [Short-Run Supply Curve]{.hi} and we will deal with this in the next lecture

For now, let's think of how profit may look if we think of it in terms of inputs
