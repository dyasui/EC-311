## Perfect Competition Assumptions {.smaller}

We will begin with [Perfectly Competitive Markets]{.hi}

And we will set some key assumptions

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="33%"}
::: {.incremental}
- [Number of Firms:]{.hi} There are a [large number of firms]{.h} in the market
    - [Any single firm's decisions has no impact on the market equilibrium]{.h}.
:::
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
::: {.incremental}
- [Products Sold:]{.hi} All firms make [identical products]{.h} 
    - This means that [consumers will treat all goods produced as perfect substitutes]{.h}.  
:::
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
::: {.incremental}
- [Barriers to Entry:]{.hi} There are [no barriers to entry/exit]{.h} 
    - This means that any new firm is free to enter the market and start producing/selling without any obstacles. Similarly, any firm that wants to exit the market can do so freely.

[The key implication from these assumptions is that firms do not have a choice on what price to charge]{.hi-orange .align-center .big}
