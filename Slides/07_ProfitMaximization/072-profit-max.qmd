## What We Have Done So Far

We learned where the [Cost Function $C(Q)$]{.hi} comes from

. . .

We also learned about properties of the [Cost Function]{.hi}:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Total Costs
- Variable Costs
- Fixed Costs
- Marginal Costs
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Average Total Costs
- Average Fixed Costs
- Average Variable Costs
:::

::::

. . .

Now we will put the [Cost Function]{.hi} to work in order to find a firm's [Supply Function]{.hi-orange}

---

## Let's First Ask: What Are Profits? {.smaller}

In Economics, we use the Greek letter $\pi$ (pi) to represent profits

And they follow an intuitive formula: 

$$
    \pi = \text{Revenue} - \text{Costs}
$$

We will also make an important distinction between [Accounting Profits]{.hi} and [Economic Profits]{.hi} where the difference comes in the costs

. . .

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
[Accounting Profits]{.hi .align-center}

[Accounting Costs]{.h} are the direct costs of operatin a business

These are what we think about when we talk about profits in accounting, finance, etc.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
[Economic Profits]{.hi .align-center}

[Economic Costs]{.hi-red} will include [Accounting Costs]{.h} and [Opportunity Costs]{.hi}

::: {.fragment}
- [Opportunity Costs]{.hi} are all foregone benefits from other possible choices once we do make a choice.
We don't necessarily observe this in the data
:::
:::

::::

. . .

[This is important concept once we consider the firm's optimal profits]{.hi .note .align-center .big}

## Profits

In simpler words, if I sell [Revenue (R)]{.hi} worth of goods and I had [Costs (C)]{.hi}, the profits are:

$$
    \pi = R - C
$$

. . .

Continuing our trend of putting things in terms of $Q$, we get:

$$
    \pi(Q) = R(Q) - C(Q)
$$

. . .

- We have already dealt with [Costs as a function of $Q$]{.hi}, that was our [Cost Function $C(Q)$]{.hi}

- Now we will figure out what [Revenue as a function of $Q$]{.hi} is

---

## Revenue

We define [Revenue]{.hi} as:

$$
    \text{Revenue} = P \cdot Q
$$

. . .

Plugging this into our Profit function gives us:

\begin{align*}
    \pi &= \color{red}{\text{Revenue}} - \text{Cost} \\
    \pi &= \color{red}{P \cdot Q} - \text{Cost}
\end{align*}

This is where Production is simpler:

::: {.incremental}
- Profits are a single-variable function
- This means that the math to maximize profits is straightforward
- We will just take the derivative and set it equal to zero
:::

---

## Maximizing Profit

Let's solve this profit maximizing problem in the most general form:

$$
    \pi = R(Q) - C(Q)
$$

. . .

[We take the derivative w.r.t. Q and set it equal to zero]{.hi .align-center}

$$
    \frac{\partial \pi}{\partial Q} = \frac{\partial R(Q)}{\partial Q} - \frac{\partial C(Q)}{\partial Q} = 0
$$

[These derivatives have their own name]{.hi .align-center}

. . .

$$
    \text{Marginal Revenue} - \text{Marginal Cost} = 0 
$$

. . .

$$ 
    \text{Marginal Revenue} = \text{Marginal Cost}
$$

---

## Maximizing Profits {.smaller}

[A firm maximizes its profits by finding the Quantity that makes Marginal Revenue equal to Marginal Cost]{.hi .note .align-center}

$$
    MR(Q) = MC(Q)
$$

. . . 

We can push this a bit further. We had just found the formula for [Revenue]{.hi}:
$$
    R(Q) = P \cdot Q 
$$

So if we take the derivative of this w.r.t. $Q$ we will find the [Marginal Revenue]{.hi}

. . .

$$
    \frac{\partial R(Q)}{\partial Q} = MR(Q) = P
$$

. . .

[Putting it all together gives us the key to finding maximum profits for a perfectly competitive firm:]{.hi .align-center}

$$
    P = MC(Q)
$$

---

## Profit Maximizing Condition

[The firm will be at its maximum profit when they meet the condition]{.hi .align-center}
$$
    P = MC(Q)
$$

. . .

From the firm's perspective, this means they sould produce exactly the level of $Q$ at which the [Marginal Cost]{.hi} of producing another unit is equal to the price it is sold at

. . .

Here's an intuitive example. Let's say you earn $5 per unit you produce:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.incremental}
- The first unit costs $1 to make
    - [You would make it!]{.hi}
- The second unit costs $2 to make
    - [You make it!]{.hi}
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.incremental}
- The third unit costs $4 to make
    - [You make it!]{.hi}
- The fourth one costs $5.01 to make
    - [You don't make it!]{.hi}
:::
:::

## Producing to Maximize Profits

So the production decision follows the rules:

::: {.incremental .align-center}
- When $P > MC$, the firm [Produces More]{.hi}!
- When $P < MC$, the firm [Does Not Produce]{.hi}
- When $P = MC$, the firm [is Maximizing Profit]{.hi}
:::

---

## Quick Math Note

[When the Cost Function is Cubic, the MC Function is Quadratic]{.h .note .align-center}

![](images/mc-price-intersection.png){fig-align="center"}

- This means that [Marginal Revenue]{.hi} will equal [Price]{.hi} at 2 pionts

- The firm will always choose the point of intersection when the [Marginal Curve]{.h} slopes upwards!

## Profit Maximization Problem 

Let the Cost Function be

$$
    C(Q) = Q^{2} + 4Q + 20 \;\;\;\;\; \& \;\;\;\;\; P = 8
$$

[1 - Find the Profit Function: $\;\; \pi(Q) = R(Q) - C(Q)$](https://wheelofnames.com/){.hi .note .align-center}

. . .

\begin{align*}
    \pi(Q) &= R(Q) - C(Q) \\ 
    \pi(Q) &= P \cdot Q - C(Q) \\
    \pi(Q) &= 8 \cdot Q - (Q^{2} + 4Q + 20) \\
    \pi(Q) &= 8Q - Q^{2} - 4Q - 20
\end{align*}

---

## Profit Maximization Problem 

$$
    \pi(Q) = 8Q - Q^{2} - 4Q - 20
$$

[2 - Find the optimal $\; Q \;$ to produce for maximum profits: $\;\; \frac{\partial \pi(Q)}{\partial Q} = 0$](https://wheelofnames.com/){.hi .note .align-center}

. . .

\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial \pi(Q)}{\partial Q} &= 0 \\
    8 - 2Q - 4 &= 0 \\
    2Q &= 4 \\
    Q^{*} &= 2
\end{align*}

---

## Another Way to Maximize Profits

Use the fact that [Marginal Cost must equal Price]{.hi}

$$
    C(Q) = Q^{2} + 4Q + 20 \;\;\;\;\; \& \;\;\;\;\; P = 8
$$

[1 - Find the Marginal Cost](https://wheelofnames.com/){.hi .note .align-center}

. . .

\begin{align*}
    MC(Q) = \frac{\partial C(Q)}{\partial Q} = 2Q + 4 
\end{align*}

. . . 

[2 - Set $\; MC(Q) = MR(Q) = P \;$](https://wheelofnames.com/){.hi .note .align-center}

. . .

[\begin{align*}
    MC(Q) &= P \\
    2Q + 4 &= 8 \\
    2Q &= 4 \\
    Q^{*} &= 2
\end{align*}]{.small}

---

## Maximizing Profit

The firm can then use the found optimal quantity, $Q^{*} = 2$, to figure out how much is their maximum profit given their costs and market price

$$
    \pi(Q) = P \cdot Q - C(Q) \;\;\;\;\; ; \;\;\;\;\; C(Q) = Q^{2} + 4Q + 20 \;\; ; \;\; P = 8
$$

\end{align*}

## Negative Profits

The previous firm's maximum profit is a loss of $16

::: {.incremental}
- [Negative Profits]{.hi} can sometimes be the optimal choice 

    - The firm would have lost more if they had produced zero $(\pi(0) = 20)$

- So even though they lost money, producing something was still better than not producing at all!

- Now that we know how profits work, we can begin to find the supply curve
