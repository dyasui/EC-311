## Expectations

[What to Expect from the Course]{.hi}

- The course involves a healthy mix of math and economic theory
    - The math is relatively straightforward, but it requires a good grasp on the theory to properly interpret it 
- More importantly than committing the theory to memory, the goal is to think like an economist
    - There is a set logic in the theory that we will see and it should lead to predictable conclusions

. . .

- [I recognize that perhaps all of you are here for the requirement in your own programs, so my aim is to make it as relevant and interesting as possible]{.tiny}

- [I'm not trying to convert you into economists, but rather have you takeaway things that you can apply in your own careers]{.tiny}

    - If you are above the class average, your doing great
