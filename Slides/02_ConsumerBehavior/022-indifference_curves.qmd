## What is Indifference?

It is exactly what it sounds like between two bundles

- Any two bundles that give the same utility level makes you indifferent between those two Bundles

For example, for the utility of $U(x,y) = 2x + 3y$ I am indifferent between bundles (3,2) and (0,4)

. . .

<br>

\begin{align*}
    U(3,2) &= 2(3) + 3(2) = 6 + 6 = 12 \\ \\
    U(0,4) &= 2(0) + 3(4) = 12
\end{align*}

## Indifference Set

Given a utility function and a level of utility, you can find a whole set of bundles that you are indifferent between

. . .

For example, let $U(x,y) = x + y$ and set $U = 10$. 
Then we can find an infinite set of $x$ and $y$ that will give us our stated utility level

. . .

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

\begin{align*}
    x &= 10 \\
    x &= 9 \\
    x &= 8 \\
      &. \\
      &. \\
      &.
\end{align*}

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

\begin{align*}
    y &= 0 \\
    y &= 1 \\
    y &= 2 \\
      &. \\
      &. \\
      &.
\end{align*}

## Indifference Curves

We can create a function that helps us find [ALL]{.h} possible bundles that make you indifferent at a given utility level

We call this an [Indifference Curve]{.hi}

For our previous utility function $U(x,y) = x + y$ where $U = 10$, we solve for $y$ and get:

. . .

\begin{align*}
    U(x,y) &= x + y \\ \\
    10 &= x + y \\ \\
    10 - x &= y \rightarrow \text{Indifference Curve (IC)}
\end{align*}

## Indifference Curve - Example

$$U(x,y) = xy \;\; \text{where} \; U = 16$$

. . .

> What type of Utility Function is this?

. . .

- It is a Cobb-Douglas $x^{a}y^{b} \text{ where } a = b = 1$

. . .

> What is the associated Indifference Curve?

. . .

$$16 = xy \rightarrow y = \dfrac{16}{x} \rightarrow \text{ IC }$$
