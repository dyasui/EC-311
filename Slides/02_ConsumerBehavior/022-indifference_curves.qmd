## What is Indifference?

It is exactly what it sounds like between two bundles

- Any two bundles that give the same utility level makes you indifferent between those two Bundles

For example, for the utility of $U(x,y) = 2x + 3y$ I am indifferent between bundles (3,2) and (0,4)

. . .

<br>

\begin{align*}
    U(3,2) &= 2(3) + 3(2) = 6 + 6 = 12 \\ \\
    U(0,4) &= 2(0) + 3(4) = 12
\end{align*}
