## Budgets 

[Economic Theory]{.hi} says that individuals make themselves as happy as they possibly can, after choosing from a set of all bundles they can afford 

- We do not just maximize utility functions, but rather we maximize them subject to [**Budget Constraints (BC)**]{.hii}

---

## Budgets - Variables

Inside a budget constraint we use the exact same variables we use in our utility function, namely $x$ and $y$

But we'll need to introduce some new notation and terminology:

. . . 

- The [price]{.h} of good $x \; \rightarrow \; P_{x}$

- The [price]{.h} of good $y \; \rightarrow \; P_{y}$

- Your income, budget, or money-on-hand $\rightarrow \; M$

    - The book also calls this $I$ 

---

## Budgets - Functional Form

Putting together our variables we get our [Budget Constraint]{.hii}

$$P_{x} \cdot x + P_{y} \cdot y \leq M$$

. . .

> [Do not let the inequality $leq$ scare you, it just means we can spend less than our total income]{.note .h}

. . .

However, in our applications we are going to treat it as a strict equality

$$P_{x} \cdot x + P_{y} \cdot y = M$$

And let's think why?

. . .

- If we are maximizing utility, it does not make sense to leave any income unspent!

---

## Budgets - Spending All Our Income

But do we usually spend [**all**]{.h} of our money?

. . .

Of course not, but here is how to think about it in the economics sense:

. . .

- When you go to the grocery store you make to choices before even stepping inside:

    1. How much to spend at the store

    2. What to spend it on

. . .

- Once you allocate your budget, you usually spend all of it

::: {.note}
The trick is to create the context in which it makes sense that everything gets spent

## Let's Construct A Budget Constraint

First, we need our two goods from before: Beer ($B$) and Soda ($S$)

Let's label everything properly:

. . .

- $B = \text{Beer}$

- $S = \text{Soda}$

- $P_{B} = \$4$

- $P_{S} = \$2$

- $M = \$20$

What does the Budget Constraint look like?

. . .

$$B \cdot P_{B} + S \cdot P_{S} = M$$

$$4B + 2P = 20$$

---

## Let's Graph A Budget Constraint

We graph the budget in the same space in as our IC, but what are we graphing?

$$P_{x} \cdot x + P_{y} \cdot y = M$$

And thankfully, this is just a straight line

---

## Bringing Intuition into Budget Constraint Graphs

$$P_{x} \cdot x + P_{y} \cdot y = M$$

Thinking intuitively, this graph represents:

. . .

- All combinations of $(x,y)$ that cost exactly $M$

. . .

- If we spend nothing on good $y$, what is the most possible $x$ that we can purchase?

. . .

\begin{align*}
    P_{x} \cdot x + P_{y} \cdot 0 &= M \\
    P_{x} \cdot x &= M \\
    x &= \dfrac{m}{P_{x}}
\end{align*}

---

## Let's Graph A Budget Constraint {.smaller}

Following the logic we just did, the budget line will connect two points:

One for when we buy only $x$ and one for when we buy only $y$

$$(\dfrac{M}{P_{x}}, 0) \text{ and } (0, \dfrac{M}{P_{y}})$$

. . .

## Interpreting the Slope of the Budget Constraint {.smaller}

The Budget Constraint is the line: 

$$y = \dfrac{M}{P_{y}} - \dfrac{P_{x}}{P_{y}} \cdot x \;\; \text{ where the slope is } \; -\dfrac{P_{x}}{P_{y}}$$

. . .

Now, let's define
$$P_{x} = \dfrac{\$}{x} \text{ and } P_{y} = \dfrac{\$}{y}$$

. . .

We get this result in terms of units!

$$\dfrac{P_{x}}{P_{y}} = \dfrac{\$/x}{\$/y} = \dfrac{\$}{x} \cdot \dfrac{y}{\$} = \dfrac{y}{x}$$

---

## The Slope of the Budget Constraint

As we just saw, the price ratio $P_{x}/P_{y}$ can be measured in units of $x$ per units of $y$

We had already seen something that is measured in units $\rightarrow$ the MRS 

. . .

This leads us to understand the differences between the two:

. . . 

- The [MRS]{.hi-orange} represents how much $y$ you [would be willing to]{.hi-orange} give up in order to get a unit of $x$

. . .

- The [Price Ratio]{.hi-grey} represents how much $y$ you [would have to]{.hi-grey} give up in order to get a unit of $x$

## What Happens When Things Change?

Budgets are not static. Prices and income can change based on market conditions so it is important to understand the effects when factors change

. . .

- We can have changes in income (increase or decrease)

- Price of $x$ can change (increase or decrease)

- Price of $y$ can change (increase or decrease)

. . .

> [Note - We normally consider what happens when only one of the possible factors change, and hold all others fixed]{.h .note}

---

## Changes in Income

What happens to the budget if income $(M)$ increases?

. . .

- $\dfrac{M}{P_{x}}$, the maximum amount of $x$ that can be purchased goes up 

- $\dfrac{M}{P_{y}}$, the maximum amount of $y$ that can be purchased goes up 

- The slope of the BC $(-P_{x}/P_{y})$ stays the same

. . .

Income changes affect the [overall amount]{.h} an individual can consume, but has [no effect on the relative cost of the goods]{.h}

. . .

> [**Intuitively, the opposite is true if income $(M)$ decreases**]{.h}

::: {.notes}
    When income increases (decreases) the budget line is pushed diagonally away (toward) the origin
:::

---

## Changes in Prices {.smaller}

What happens to the budget if the price of good $x$ $(P_{x})$ increases?

. . .

- The maximum amount of $x$ that can be consumed goes down $(\dfrac{M}{P_{x}}) \downarrow$

- The maximum amount of $y$ that can be consumed stays the same  $(\dfrac{M}{P_{x}})$

- The price ratio $(- \dfrac{P_{x}}{P_{y}})$ becomes steeper

. . .

> [**Once more, the opposite happens with a decrease**]{.h}

> [**How about a shift in $P_{y}$ ?**]{.h}
