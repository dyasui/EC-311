## Where Does Demand Come From?

Imagine the market for coffee on campus

- Additionally, picture that the only other good that can be purchased is tea

- On a basic level, [demand for coffee]{.hii} is derived from individual's choosing how to divide their income between coffee and tea

```{r, fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2)

# Create data for the supply and demand curves
quantity <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60)
price_supply <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
price_demand <- c(6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)

# Create a data frame
curve_data <- data.frame(quantity, price_supply, price_demand)

# Create the plot
ggplot(curve_data, aes(x = quantity)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = price_supply), color = "blue", size = 1, linetype = "solid") +
  geom_line(aes(y = price_demand), color = "red", size = 1, linetype = "solid") +
  labs(
    y = "Price",
    x = "Quantity"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  annotate("text", x = 60, y = 5.75, label = "S", color = "blue", size = 8) +
  annotate("text", x = 58, y = 1, label = "D", color = "red", size = 8)
```
