## Where Does Demand Come From?

Imagine the market for coffee on campus

- Additionally, picture that the only other good that can be purchased is tea

- On a basic level, [demand for coffee]{.hii} is derived from individual's choosing how to divide their income between coffee and tea

```{r supply-demand, fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2)

# Create data for the supply and demand curves
quantity <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60)
price_supply <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
price_demand <- c(6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)

# Create a data frame
curve_data <- data.frame(quantity, price_supply, price_demand)

# Create the plot
ggplot(curve_data, aes(x = quantity)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = price_supply), color = "blue", lwd = 2, linetype = "solid") +
  geom_line(aes(y = price_demand), color = "red", lwd = 2, linetype = "solid") +
  labs(
    y = "Price",
    x = "Quantity"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  annotate("text", x = 60, y = 5.65, label = "S", color = "blue", size = 8) +
  annotate("text", x = 60, y = 1.3, label = "D", color = "red", size = 8)
```

## Where Does Demand Come From?

This is the problem we will be dealing with through the first half of the course

> How does an individual allocate a [finite amount of resources]{.hii} between [two goods]{.hii}?

. . .

<br>

[Note:]{.h .note} There are clearly more than just two goods out there, so how can this be useful?

[The main critique I always hear about economics courses is that they're unrealistic. That's mostly true, but we can learn about the aggregate by simplifying and making assumptions]{.h .note}
---

## Where Does Demand Come From?

- We will frame the decisions as a two-good model where you may choose between:

  - Food and durable consumption
  - Leisure (not working) and consumption (paid for by earning a wage)
  - Consumption now and consumption later

> [The key takeaway here is that we can frame many important choices as "two-good" decisions]{.h .note}

- This makes things simpler for us to solve while still maintaining some sense of the real world

---

## Determinants of Consumption

Consumption of any single good has two parts:

- How it [BENEFITS]{.hii} the consumer 

  - We call this [UTILITY]{.hii}

- What it [COSTS]{.hii} the consumer

  - What we give up to purchase the good

. . .

Let's see what this means through a 1-good example $\rightarrow$ Beer

- Imagine the following scenario:

  - You just arrived at the bar and have had zero drinks so far
  - Each beer costs the same: $4

## Intuition Behind "Choice" in Economics

You [cannot]{.hi-red} simply find the consumption amount that makes you the happiest. 
[But why?]{.hi}

. . .

> The goal is to maximize your [utility]{.hii} whilst acknowledging you have [constraints]{.hii}
>
> The choice is simple: [consume an additional unit until the cost of doing so outweighs the benefit]{.hii}

<br>

. . .

[Commit this idea to memory: it is the crux of economics and drives everything we will be doing]{.hi .note}

[We maximize utility up to the point that it does not make sense to do so]{.hi .note}

Some Questions:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- What is the marginal benefit:
  - When you have not consumed any beer?
  - When you have already consumed 3 beers?
  - When you have already consumed 5 beers?
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- What is the marginal cost of beer? 
  - Does it change as we consume more?
:::

## Being and Thinking at the Margin

We found two important values:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- [Marginal Benefit (MB)]{.hi}

::: {.fragment}
The additional benefit gained for an added unit of consumption
:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- [Marginal Cost (MC)]{.hi}

::: {.fragment}
The additional cost paid for an added unit of consumption 
:::

:::

::::

. . .

We can describe the decision-making process in a more formal manner:

- Initially: [MB]{.hi-green} > [MC]{.hi-red} $\rightarrow$ Consume more!
- Eventually: [MB]{.hi-green} < [MC]{.hi-red} $\rightarrow$ We went too far!
- At some point: [MB]{.hi-green} = [MC]{.hi-red} $\rightarrow$ Just right!

> [Ask yourself: Why must they be equal?]{.hi .note}

## What's Going On? Graphically 

```{r beer-utility, fig.align='center'}
# Load the ggplot2 library if not already loaded
library(ggplot2)

# Create a data frame with x values
data <- data.frame(x = c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6), y = c(0,10,25,35,40,42,30))

# Create the ggplot object
utility <- ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_line(color = "black", size = 2) +
  xlim(0,6) +
  labs(
    x = "Beers",
    y = "Utility"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

utility
```

. . .

What matters for choice is the [marginal benefit]{.hi} of an additional beer

In other words, what matters is the change in [utility]{.hii} that occurs as we move to the right on the graph

. . .

> [Recall: A change in $y$ as $x$ increases is the derivative]{.h .note}

---

## What's Going On? Graphically - Derivatives

```{r beer-utility-derivative, fig.align='center'}
utility
```

The derivative of this function is the [marginal benefit]{.hi} of beer

[This is why derivatives are important]{.h .note}

We can use derivatives to figure out the optimal amount to consume

---

## What's Going On? Graphically - MB & MC

```{r beer-utility-derivative1, fig.align='center'}
utility
```

> [Recall:]{.hi .note} The optimal choice is the point where [MB]{.hi-green} = [MC]{.hi-red} 

> The [MC]{.hi-red} = 4. So we would choose the quantity of beers where [MB]{.hi-green} = 4 

---

## What's Going On? Mathematically

The utility function of beer we've been using is:

$$U(x) = -x^{2} + 12x$$

[Let's practice:]{.h} 
What would the optimal consumption amount be if the cost of beer is $2?

## A Two-Good Problem

The beer example was fairly straightforward. But we will be dealing with making choices between two goods. 

Before we dive in, a couple of things to consider are:

. . .

- When we spend our resources on one good, it cannot be spent on something else
  - Because we are making decisions amongst both things, we need a [cost relationship]{.hi} between them

. . .

- We do not measure our happiness (utility) in dollars
  - We need to find a way to choose without directly comparing costs and benefits across goods

--- 

## Enter Utility Functions {.smaller}

A [Utility Function]{.hi} is a function of two variables:

$$U = f(x,y)$$

[Some facts:]{.h}

- $x$ and $y$ are the (positive) amounts of goods you consume
- The function converts $x$ and $y$ to happiness (utility) from consuming the two goods

. . . 

[For Example:]{.h}

- Let's say that the utility I receive from [Beer (B)]{.h} and [Soda (S)]{.h} can be modeled as:

$$U = f(B,S) = 10B + 2S$$

- Before, we were only interested in the slope of Beer
- Now, we are interested in the [slopes]{.hii} of both Beer & Soda

---

## Utility Functions - Beer & Soda

$$U = f(B,S) = 10B + 2S$$

For a function of two variables there are [two slopes]{.hi}

- One for each [partial derivative]{.hii} which we will call [Marginal Utilities]{.hii}

. . .

- In the [Beer (B)]{.h} and [Soda (S)]{.h} example we will have:

  - The [Marginal Utility of Beer]{.hii} [($MU_{B}$)]{.h}
  - The [Marginal Utility of Soda]{.hii} [($MU_{S}$)]{.h}

. . .

> What are the Marginal Utilities of Beer and Soda?

---

## Utility Functions - PB&J

Now find the Marginal Utilities for Peanut Butter and Jelly

$$U = f(P,J) = P^{2} \cdot J$$

. . . 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

[Peanut Butter]{.hi}

::: {.fragment}

\begin{align*}
  MU_{P} &= 2P^{2-1} \cdot J = 2PJ \\
\end{align*}

:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

[Jelly]{.hi}

::: {.fragment}

\begin{align*}
  MU_{J} &= P^{2} \cdot J^{1-1} = P^{2} \\
\end{align*}

:::

:::

::::

---

## What do Utility Functions even Mean?

They help us represent how people feel about goods $x$ and $y$

There are certain properties that help us determine:

. . .

- Do I [like or dislike]{.hi} $x$?

- Does [how much I like]{.hi} $x$ depend on [how much $x$ I already have]{.hi}?

- Does [how much I like]{.hi} $x$ depend on [how much $y$ I have]{.hi}?

. . .

> [We can understand these properties by looking at the marginal utilities!]{.h .note .big}

---

## Utility Functions - Do I Like or Dislike $x$?

> [If I consume more $x$, how does my utility move?]{.h .note .big}

Beyond graphing the utility function, we need to find a way to answer this formally and mathematically

. . . 

We can look at the [sign of the derivative]{.hi}

- If the derivative of $U$ with respect to (w.r.t.) $x$ is:

. . .

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
[Positive]{.hi-green}

::: {.fragment}
I like $x$
:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
[Negative]{.hi-red}

::: {.fragment}
I dislike $x$
:::

:::

::::

---

## Like or Dislike - Example

Given my utility curve for [Beer (B)]{.h} and [Soda (S)]{.h}, what do I like or dislike?

$$U = f(B,S) = 10B + 2S$$

. . .

<br>
<br>

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
I like [Beer]{.h}

::: {.fragment}
$$MU_{B} = 10 > 0$$
:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
I like [Soda]{.h}

::: {.fragment}
$$MU_{S} = 2 > 0$$
:::

:::
::::

---

## Does How Much I like $x$ Depend on How Much I Already Have?

> [Remember to think at the margin]{.h .note}

Is each additional unit of $x$ bring me [more]{.hi-green}, [less]{.hi-red}, or [equal]{.hi-teal} happiness as the previous unit?

. . .

<br>

This is slightly trickier to figure out, but we still use marginal utility logic

- In fact, we will use what is called the [Second Derivative]{.hi}

- Mathematically, this is the [derivative]{.h} of $MU_{x}$ w.r.t. $x$ and we ask:

  - Is this [second derivative]{.h} [positive]{.hi-green}, [negative]{.hi-red}, or [zero]{.hi-teal}?

---

## Depend on How Much I Already Have - Example

My utility for [Cookies]{.h} and [Milk]{.h}:

$$U = f(C,M) = C^{1/2}M^{1/2}$$

. . . 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

[Cookies]{.h}

::: {.fragment .tiny}
$MU_{c} = \dfrac{1}{2} \cdot C^{-1/2} \cdot M^{1/2}$
$MU_{cc} = \dfrac{-1}{2} \cdot \dfrac{1}{2} \cdot C^{-1/2 - 1} \cdot M^{1/2}$
$MU_{cc} = \dfrac{-1}{4} \cdot \dfrac{1}{C^{3/2}} \cdot M^{1/2}$
$MU_{cc} = \dfrac{-M^{1/2}}{4C^{3/2}}$
:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

[Milk]{.h}

::: {.fragment}
$U_{mm} = \dfrac{-C^{1/2}}{4M^{3/2}}$
:::

<br>

::: {.fragment}
$MU_{cc}$ is [negative]{.hi-red} so we can say that [Cookies]{.h} have a Decreasing Marginal Utility
:::

:::

::::  

---

## Does How Much I Like $x$ Depend on How Much $y$ I Have?

This one is more straightforward: Does the marginal utility of $x$ depend on $y$?

- Mathematically, we take the derivative  of $MU_{x}$ w.r.t. to $y$, and vice-versa. 
  
  - This is called the [cross-partial derivative]{.h}

- Notationally, we have: $MU_{xy}$

Where we can determine the order of derivatives by looking at the subscript:

- $x$ is first, and $y$ is the second derivative

---

## Depend on How Much of the Other Good I Have - Example

How about this utility for Peanut Butter and Jelly

$$U = f(P,J) = P^{2} \cdot J$$

. . .

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

[Peanut Butter]{.hi}

::: {.fragment}

\begin{align*}
  MU_{P} &= 2P^{2-1} \cdot J = 2PJ \\
  MU_{PJ} &= 2P \cdot J^{1-1} = 2P
\end{align*}

:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

[Jelly]{.hi}

## Meaning of a Utility Function

What are Utility Functions?

. . .

- They are a flexible tool that help us describe the relationship between two goods and the utility (happiness) you gain from them

. . .

- They allow us to get a good intuition of how we can change function properties so they relate to the choice we are attempting to model

. . .

- Let's think about some goods and decide what the utility function should look like

---

## Modeling with Utility Functions

Let's consider [Homework]{.hi} and [Pizza]{.hi}

. . .

- First, we decide whether the good is desirable [(good)]{.hi-green} or undesirable [(bad)]{.hi-red}

  ::: {.fragment}

  - I'll make the bold assumption that [Homework]{.hi} is a bad and that [Pizza]{.hi} is a good

  :::

  ::: {.fragment}

  > [Note: This implies that the marginal utilities are $MU_{H} < 0$ and $MU_{P} > 0$]{.h .note}

  :::

---

## Modeling with Utility Functions - Example

[Homework]{.hi} is a [bad]{.hi-red} and [Pizza]{.hi} is a [good]{.hi-green}

. . .

Let's also set the following requirements:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

The [marginal disutility]{.hi-red} of [homework]{.hi} is larger when I have more of it

::: {.fragment}

$MU_{H}$ is decreasing in $H \; \rightarrow \;$ We need an $H$ in $MU_{H}$

:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

The [marginal utility]{.hi-green} of [pizza]{.hi} is smaller when I have more of it

::: {.fragment}

$MU_{P}$ becomes smaller as I have more $P \; \rightarrow \;$ We need an $H$ in $MU_{H}$

$MU_{P}$ does [**not**]{.h} depend on [homework]{.hi} $MU_{P}$ does not have an $H$

:::

:::

::::

. . .

> [Attempt creating a utility function with the above characteristics]{.h .note}

---

## Modeling our Homework and Pizza {.smaller}

Here's my version:

$$U(H,P) = -H^{2} + ln(P)$$

Now let's prove that it meets the requirements 

. . . 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

[Homework]{.hi} is a [bad]{.hi-red} and must be worse the more I have of interested

:::: {.fragment}

$$MU_{H} = -2H < 0$$

$$MU_{HH} = -2 <0$$

::::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

[Pizza]{.hi} is a [good]{.hi-green}, I get less joy from it the more I have, and it does not depend on how much [homework]{.hi} I have

:::: {.fragment}

$$MU_{P} = \dfrac{1}{P} > 0 $$

$$MU_{PP} = \dfrac{-1}{P^{2}} < 0$$

$$MU_{PH} = 0 = MU_{HP}$$

::::

:::

## Meaning of a Utility function

The single most important property of a utility function is that we can measure [**the relative preference for one good over the other**]{.h}

- We can measure [how many units of $y$ would you give up to get one more unit of $x$?]{.hi}

  - We call this the [Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)]{.hii}

$$MRS = \dfrac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}}$$

---

## Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)

Here we are talking about the relative preference of $x$ over $y$, but how?

. . .

- Consider $U = f(x,y) = 4x + 2y$

  - You get 4 units of utility for each $x \; \rightarrow \; 4$

  - You get 2 units of utility for each $y \; \rightarrow \; 2$

  - We can say that each $x$ is twice as valuable as each $y$

. . .

Using our MRS formula we have:

$$MRS = \dfrac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}} = \dfrac{4}{2} = 2$$

---

## Types of Utility Functions

In Economics, we mainly deal with 4 types of functions, each with its set of properties and tricks

. . .

- Cobb-Douglas

- Quasi-linear

- Perfect Substitutes

- Perfect Complements

---

## Cobb-Douglas

$$U(x,y) = x^{a}y^{b}$$

> [**Find the MRS of this general function**]{.note .h}

. . .

$$MRS = \dfrac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}} = \dfrac{ax^{a-1}y^{b}}{bx^{a}y^{b-1}} = \dfrac{a}{b} \cdot \dfrac{x^{a-1-a}}{y^{b-1-b}} = \dfrac{a}{b} \cdot \dfrac{x^{-1}}{y^{-1}} = \dfrac{a}{b} \cdot \dfrac{y}{x}$$

. . .

> [**The MRS for a Cobb-Douglas will always look like**]{.note .h}
>
> $$\dfrac{a}{b} \cdot \dfrac{y}{x}$$

---

## Cobb-Douglas: Keys to Remember

$$MRS = \dfrac{a}{b} \cdot \dfrac{y}{x}$$

- The MRS is a ratio of $y$ to $x$, multiplied by a constant

- MRS is your [willingness to trade $y$ for $x$]{.h}

- As you get more $x$, the MRS goes down

- As you get more $y$, the MRS goes up

---

## Cobb-Douglas - Example

$$U(x,y) = x^{3}y^{1/2}$$

> [**Find the MRS of this utility function**]{.note .h}

. . .

$$MRS = \dfrac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}} = \dfrac{3x^{2}y^{1/2}}{1/2x^{3}y^{-1/2}} = \dfrac{3}{1/2} \cdot \dfrac{y^{1/2}y^{1/2}}{x^{3}x^{-2}} = 6 \cdot \dfrac{y}{x}$$

. . .

If we recall that $MRS = \dfrac{a}{b} \cdot \dfrac{y}{x}$ then we can take a shortcut:

$$MRS = \dfrac{a}{b} \cdot \dfrac{y}{x} \rightarrow \dfrac{3}{1/2} \cdot \dfrac{y}{x} = 6 \cdot \dfrac{y}{x}$$

::: {.notes}
Introduce log transformation here
:::


---

## Quasi-Linear

$$U(x,y) = a \cdot ln(x) + b \cdot y$$

Where $a \cdot ln(x)$ is the ["quasi"]{.h} part and $b \cdot y$ is the ["linear"]{.h} part

> [**Find the MRS of this general function**]{.note .h}

. . .

$$MRS = \dfrac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}} = \dfrac{a/x}{b} = \dfrac{a}{b} \cdot \dfrac{1}{x}$$

---

## Quasi-Linear: Keys to Remember

$$MRS = \dfrac{a}{b} \cdot \dfrac{1}{x}$$

- The MRS is a constant times $1/x$

- As you get more $x$, the MRS decreases

- As you get more $y$, the MRS remains the same

---

## Quasi-Linear - Example

$$U(x,y) = 1/3 \cdot ln(x) + y$$

> [**Find the MRS of this utility function**]{.note .h}

. . .

$$MRS = \dfrac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}} = \dfrac{1/3 \cdot 1/x}{1} = \dfrac{1}{3} \cdot \dfrac{1}{x}$$

. . .

Using our shortcut we get:

$$MRS = \dfrac{a}{b} \cdot \dfrac{1}{x} = \dfrac{1/3}{1} \cdot \dfrac{1}{x} = \dfrac{1}{3} \cdot \dfrac{1}{x}$$

---

## Perfect Substitutes

$$U(x,y) = a \cdot x + b \cdot y$$

> [**Find the MRS of this general function**]{.note .h}

. . .

$$MRS = \dfrac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}} = \dfrac{a}{b}$$

### Keys to Remember

- MRS is a constant

---

## Perfect Substitutes - Example

$$U(x,y) = 6x + \dfrac{1}{2} y $$

> [**Find the MRS of this utility function**]{.note .h}

. . .

$$MRS = \dfrac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}} = \dfrac{6}{1/2} = 12$$

. . .

And our shortcut shows:

$$MRS = \dfrac{6}{1/2} = 12$$

---

## Perfect Complements

$$U(x,y) = \min \{a \cdot x, b \cdot y \}$$

This utility function requires a different form of intuition

Let's first think of a simple example:

. . .

Imagine we are trying to make some hot chocolate which requires 1 pack of chocolate powder and 12 oz of milk

$$U(x,y) = \min \{1 \, choco, 12oz \, milk \}$$

. . .

## Perfect Complements Intuition

These are goods that [**have to be consumed together in an exact proportion**]{.h} in order to produce any utility 

> There is no MRS, so we use a property called the [No-Waste Condition]{.hi}:
>
> $$U(x,y) = \min \{a \cdot x, b \cdot y \}$$
>
> $$a \cdot x = b \cdot y$$

---

## Perfect Complements: Keys to Remember

- MRS is not defined (We cannot take a derivative)

- We can use the [No-Waste Condition]{.hi}:

  - When $a \cdot x < b \cdot y$ you will give up any $y$ you can to get more $x$

  - When $a \cdot x > b \cdot y$ you will give up any $x$ you can to get $y$

---

## Perfect Complements - Example 

$$U(x,y) = \min \{ \dfrac{x}{2}, \dfrac{y}{4} \}$$

> [**Find the No-Waste Condition of this utility function**]{.note .h}

. . .

No-Waste Condition is $\dfrac{x}{2} = \dfrac{y}{4} \rightarrow 4x = 2y \rightarrow 2x = y$

. . .

We can say: 

- If $2x > y \; \rightarrow \;$ Too much $x$, so we would trade some $x$ for some $y$

- If $2x < y \; \rightarrow \;$ Too much $y$, so we would trade some $y$ for some $x$

## Bundles

When you have a utility function of two goods, any given combination of those two goods is called a [Bundle]{.hi}

- Every [bundle]{.hi} has an associated utility level

Take the following utility function and bundles

$$U(x,y) = x^{2}y$$

. . .   

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Bundle 1 is (3,2)

:::: {.fragment}

\begin{align*}
  U(3,2) &= 3^{2} \cdot 2 \\
         &= 9 \cdot 2 = 18
\end{align*}

::::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

Bundle 2 is (1,0)

:::: {.fragment}

\begin{align*}
  U(1,0) &= 1^{2} \cdot 0 \\
         &= 1 \cdot 0 = 0
\end{align*}

## Bundles & Axioms of Preferences

:::: {.notes}

Let's first define what an Axiom is

- A proposition that is assumed to be true without proof for the sake of studying the consequences that follow from it

::::

We will use the following axioms about preferences between bundles to ensure logical consistency

. . .

- Completeness

. . .

- "More is Better"

. . .

- Transitivity

. . .

> [These come from economic theory so they will help you think like an economist but do not think this tells us how people behave]{.h .note}

. . .

> [We are attempting to successfully predict behavior, so we will simply assume that everyone behaves accordingly]{.h .note}

---

## Completeness 

We say that preferences are always [complete]{.hi}. So when comparing bundles A and B, you can always say one of the following:

. . .

- I prefer A to B ($A \succeq B$)

- I prefer B to A ($B \succeq A$)

- I am indifferent between A and B ($A \sim B$) 

. . .

This allows us to compare and order any pair of bundles

---

## "More is Better"

Or at least more is no worse than less

. . .

In general, if a good is desirable we will want more of it

- However, sometimes products can be bads (instead of goods) and we would, obviously, want less of those

---

## Transitivity

Preferences are transitive. This means that when comparing bundles A, B, and C you can get logical orderings through rankings:

. . . 

- If you prefer B to A ($B \succeq A$) and C to B ($C \succeq B$) then you must prefer C to A ($C \succeq A$)

. . .

## Transitivity

What would this graph mean?

![](Images\Transitivity-Equal-line.png){fig-align="center"}

. . .

All bundles are preferred equally!

## Preferences Assumptions

All of these are necessary to understand utility funcitons and be able to graph them

To do so we first need to learn about [Indifference Curves]{.hii}
