## How Perfect is Perfect?

Up to now, we have assumed that the market is operating under [Perfect Competition]{.h}, but how reasonable of an assumption is this?

::: {.incremental}
- In some contexts, producers do have to worry about how much they produce because it will direclty impact the market price
    - Professional Sport Leagues
        - If they add more games to their seasons, it will likely decrease ticket prices due to higher quantity supplied
    - Actors/Actresses
        - If they are selective in the roles they take, they are able to demand higher pay for each one

## Imperfect Competition

All firms that have to worry about their quantity produced share something in common:

::: {.incremental}
- They make something unique (or at elast "locally unique")

- Because their goods cannot be easily obtained elsewhere, one firm's production will impact the price of the market
    - We are no longer assuming they are perfect substitutes

. . .

In the extreme case, where a single firm is the sole producer of a unique good, they are called a [Monopoly]{.hi-red}

## Monopoly

We will figure out how a [Monopoly Firm (Monopolist)]{.hi-red} chooses how much to produce, and how this implies they set the market price
