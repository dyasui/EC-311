## What is a Monopoly's Marginal Revenue?

We find [Marginal Revenue]{.hi} in the same way we have done before, we look at Revenue and take the derivative

Let's look at a general case

. . .

Assume a linear Demand Curve: $\;\;\; P = a - b \cdot Q_{D}$


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
[We first find Revenue]{.hi .align-center}

::: {.fragment .small}
\begin{align*}
    R(Q) &= \color{red}{P} \cdot Q_{S} \\
    R(Q) &= \color{red}{(a - b \cdot Q_{D})} \cdot Q_{S}
\end{align*}
:::

::: {.fragment .small}
[Remember $\; Q_{S} = Q_{D} = Q$]{.hi .align-center}

\begin{align*}
    R(Q) &= (a - b \cdot Q) \cdot Q \\
    R(Q) &= aQ - bQ^{2}
\end{align*}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
[Find the Derivative]{.hi .align-center}

<br>

::: {.fragment .small}
\begin{align*}
    MR(Q) &= \frac{\partial R(Q)}{\partial Q} \\ \\
    MR(Q) &= a - 2bQ
\end{align*}

## Monopoly Marginal Revenue {.smaller}

$$
    \text{Demand: } P = a - b \cdot Q \;\;\;\; ; \;\;\;\; \text{Marginal Revenue: } P = a - 2bQ
$$

A [Monopolist's Marginal Revenue Curve]{.hi-red} is just like the [Demand Curve]{.hi}, except it is [twice as steep]{.hi}

## How Monopolists Make Their Choices

We know that [Monopolists]{.hi-red} set [MR = MC]{.hi} to maximize profits, but this only tells us the [Quantity]{.hi}

## How Monopolists Make Their Choices

To find the [price $P_{M}^{*}$]{.hi} they demand at $Q_{M}^{*}$, we have to take one additional step

We will use the [Demand Curve]{.hi} 

::: {.incremental}
- The [Monopolist]{.hi-red} chose their quantity while knowing that their choice determines market price [through the Demand Curve]{.hi} 
:::

## How Monopolists Determine Their Market Price

We follow the [Monopoly Quantity]{.hi-red} up to the [Demand Curve]{.hi}

## Monopoly Market Equilibrium

To summarize:

::: {.incremental}
- We use the [Demand Curve]{.hi} to find the [Marginal Revenue Curve]{.hi}
- The [Monopolist]{.hi-red} produces the [quantity]{.hi-red} determined by setting [MR = MC]{.hi}
- The [Monopolist Price]{.hi-red} is determined by the [Demand Curve]{.hi} at [$Q_{M}^{*}$]{.hi-red}

## How Does This Compare to Perfect Competition?

We already showed that the [Monopolists]{.hi-red} will produce less and demand a higher price

We can also show this on the same graph, which is useful to visualize what is happening

::: {.incremental}
- Recall that the [Marginal Cost Curve]{.hi} is the same thing as the [Supply Curve]{.hi} in [Perfect Competition]{.hi-green}

- The [Perfect Competition Price & Quantity]{.hi-green} is where [Demand equals Supply]{.hi}

## Monopoly + Perfect Competition

## Why Restrict Quantity?

[Monopolists]{.hi-red} make an active choice to restrict quantity supplied, but why?

::: {.incremental}
- It makes them higher profits

. . .

## Monopoly Long-Run Profits 

The question is

[Why aren't Monopolies simply eliminated by competition in the Long-Run?]{.hi .align-center}

. . .

There's two exaplanations:

::: {.incremental .small}
1. [Monopolists]{.hi-red} can only exist when there are [Barriers to Entry]{.hi} that other firms cannot overcome
    - These tend to be either physical (think infrastructure) or legal (regulatory)
2. Even when there exist multiple firms in the market, they ["collude"]{.hi} with one another and [act as if they were a monopoly]{.hi} 
    - We call this a [Cartel]{.hi}
