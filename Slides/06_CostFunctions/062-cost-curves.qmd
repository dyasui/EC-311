## What The Hell Is A Cost Function?

Our goal for the second half of the class is to minimize costs.

We will do this by deriving a [minimzed cost function]{.hi} but what even is it?

Let's begin by introducing some useful notation:

::: {.incremental}
- The [minimized cost function]{.hi-red} will be [$C^{*}(Q)$]{.hi-red}
    - This function tells us that for any given quantity $(Q)$, [$C^{*}(Q)$]{.hi-red} represents the cheapest way possible to produce $Q$
:::

. . .

We will leverage this information:

> [Knowing]{.h .note} [$C^{*}(Q)$]{.hi-red} [means that we do not have to solve the cost minimization problem to figure out how much it will cost you to produce a target quantity]{.h .note}

---

## Cost Functions

The general formula for a [cost function]{.hi-red} is:

$$
    C^{*}(Q) = wL^{*}(Q) + rK^{*}(Q)
$$

::: {.incremental}
To find this we will

- Find the MRST and set it equal to the price ratio
- Plug into our Q constraint and find a $L^{*}$ and $K^{*}$ in terms of $Q$
- Find the cost of the optimal $L^{*}$ and $K^{*}$
:::

. . .

Last lecture we found levels of $L^{*}$ and $K^{*}$ when we knew $Q$. 
Now we will keep $Q$ as a variable so we can find costs for any possible quantity. 

---

## Cost Function Example - Step 1

Let's say we are faced with the following problem:

$$
    \min 10L + 10K \;\;\;\; s.t. \;\;\;\; \bar{Q} = f(L,K) = L^{1/4}K^{1/4}
$$

    \text{MRTS} &= \frac{MU_{L}}{MU_{K}} \\ 
    &= \frac{1/4 \cdot L^{-3/4}K^{1/4}}{1/4 \cdot L^{1/4}K^{-3/4}} \\ 
    &= \frac{K^{1/4}K^{3/4}}{L^{1/4}L^{3/4}} =  \frac{K}{L} \\ \\

## Cost Function Example - Step 2

$$
    K = L \;\;\;\; \text{recall:} \;\; \bar{Q} = f(L,K) = L^{1/4}K^{1/4}
$$

We found our Optimality Condition for $K$ and $L$

[Plug into Q-Constraint to find $\; L^{*}(Q) \;$ and $\; K^{*}(Q) \;$](https://wheelofnames.com/){.note .hi .align-center}

\begin{align*}
    Q &= F(L,K) = L^{1/4}\color{red}{K^{1/4}} \\
    Q &= L^{1/4}\color{red}{L^{1/4}} = L^{1/2} \\ 
    Q &= L^{1/2} \\
\end{align*}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

\begin{align*}
    L^{1/2} &= Q \\
    (L^{1/2})^{\color{red}{2}} &= Q^{\color{red}{2}} \\
    L^{*} &= Q^{2} \\ 
    K^{*} &= Q^{2}
\end{align*}
:::

:::

## Cost Function Example - Step 3

$$
    L^{*} = Q^{2} \;\;\; \& \;\;\; K^{*} = Q^{2} \;\;\;\; \text{recall:} \; C(Q) = 10L + 10K
$$

We found our optimal [Labor]{.hi} and [Capital]{.hi} choices are in terms of $Q$

[Find $\; C^{*}(Q) \;$ using $\; L^{*} \;$ and $\; K^{*}$](https://wheelofnames.com/){.note .hi .align-center}

. . .

\begin{align*}
    C^{*}(Q) &= 10 \cdot \color{red}{L^{*}(Q)} + 10 \cdot \color{red}{K^{*}(Q)} \\
    C^{*}(Q) &= 10 \cdot \color{red}{Q^{2}} + 10 \cdot \color{red}{Q^{2}} \\
    C^{*}(Q) &= 20 \cdot Q^{2}

## Why Bother With Cost Functions?

To begin, they are very useful in industry

Let's think back to our Ducks jersey example. 
Nike wants you to make 20,000 jerseys. 
All you do is turn around and say it will cost 

\begin{align*}
    C^{*}(Q) &= 20 \cdot Q^{2} \\ 
    C^{*}(20,000) &= 20 \cdot 20,000^{2} \\ 
    C^{*}(20,000) &= 20 \cdot 400,000,000 = 8,000,000,000
\end{align*}

. . . 

But then with Bo Nix being gone, they only need 1,000 jerseys

So you say: That sucks, I thought we were better than just Bo, but okay. It'll cost:

$$
    C^{*}(1,000) = 20 \cdot 1,000^{2} = 20,000,000
$$

---

## Why Bother With Cost Functions?

More generally, as the factory manager, you would just share your cost function with Nike and they can:

::: {.incremental}
- Use it to figure out the optimal number of jerseys tor produce, taking costs of production into account
- We will introduce profits later
- This decision is where [Supply]{.hi} will come from
:::

. . .

But before we can get into [Profit Maximization]{.h}, we will dive deeper into understanding cost functions

---

## What Goes Into Cost Functions?

Beyond wages and rental rates, e[con]{.hi-red}omists think about costs in a different way:

. . .

[We consider ALL foregone alternatives that we could have used our resources in]{.hi .align-center} 

We call this [opportunity cost]{.hi}:

- It is the value of inputs when used for their best alternative use

---

## Understanding Cost Functions

Knowing what is considered as costs in economics helps us with the theory part of production

- It will play a larger role when we deal with profit maximization

. . .

For now, we can figure out how we expect cost functions to behave:

Assume a generic cost function such that $C = F(Q)$

::: {.incremental}
- When $Q$ [increases]{.hi} what do we expect to happen to $C$?
    - They should [INCREASE]{.hi}

- It usually costs more to make more goods

- This means that the first derivative $(C'(Q))$ should be?

    - Positive $\; \rightarrow C'(Q) > 0$
:::

---

## Derivative of $C(Q)$

The derivative of $C(Q)$ is [very important]{.hi}

So much so that we give it a name: [Marginal Cost (MC)]{.hi}

![](images/marginal-cost-1.png){fig-align="center"}

---

## Marginal Costs

We will add an additional assumption to make our lives easier

[Assume that firms production functions exhibit decreasing returns]{.h .note .align-center}

::: {.incremental}
- This has a direct implication on our [Marginal Cost curve]{.hi}
    - $MC(Q)$ will increase as $Q$ increases
    - It becomes more expensive to make an additional unit as you make more and more
- So [Decreasing Returns to Scale (DRS)]{.hi} = [Increasing Marginal Costs]{.hi}
:::

---

## Marginal Cost Curves

![](images/marginal-cost-2.png){fig-align="center"}

---

## Cost of Producing Nothing? {.smaller}

Does it actually cost nothing to make nothing?

We will assume that there exists some form of overhead or [fixed costs]{.hi} associated with producing goods

::: {.incremental}
- A business pays rent on their warehouse no matter how empty or full it is
- A restaurant has to purchase a license in order to serve food/alcohol
:::

. . . 

![](images/marginal-cost-3.png){fig-align="center" height="400"}

---

## How Realistic are Cost Functions?

A good thinker is initially skeptical. So let's cast some doubt on our [Increasing Marginal Cost assumption]{.hi} 

::: {.fragment}
Isn't producing in bulk sometimes much easier than producing small quantities? 

- The existence of Costco tells us yes
:::

. . .

::: {.incremental}
So this is true, but only up to a point

- We are perfectly comforable modeling firms that [initially experience decreasing marginal costs]{.hi} but at a high-enough quantity produced, they [must experience increasing marginal costs]{.hi}
:::

---

## Initial Decreasing Marginal Costs with Increasing Marginal Costs At High Quantity

![](images/marginal-cost-4.png){fig-align="center"}

---

## Total Cost

Up to now we have expressed firm's costs as 

$$
    TC(Q) = w \cdot L^{*}(Q) + r \cdot K^{*}(Q)
$$

Which let's us know the cheapest way to produce a given target $Q$

. . .

We can also express costs as a function of quantity

$$
    TC(Q) = f(Q) + F
$$

Where $F$ is a non-negative constant

[We will split these costs up by type (i.e. More Cost Functions!)]{.hi .align-center}

---

## Decomposing Costs

Costs will fall into one of two categories: 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
[Fixed Costs]{.hi}

::: {.fragment}
Costs that are paid even if the firm produces nothing $\rightarrow C(0)$
:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
[Variable Costs]{.hi}

::: {.fragment}
Costs that are increasing in the quantity produced (e.g. materials and labor used to produce each unit)
:::

:::

::::

. . .

In its simplest form, total cost can be written as

$$
    \text{Total Cost} = \text{Variable Costs} + \text{Fixed Costs}
$$

---

## Fixed Costs (FC)

These are costs the firm has to pay [even if it produces 0 units of output]{.hi}

- [Also known as the intercept of the Cost Function]{.hi}

$$
    FC = TC(0) = f(0) + F = F
$$

. . .

We can find these by setting $Q = 0$

. . .

<br>
[Find the Fixed Costs for the following Cost Function](https://wheelofnames.com/){.h .align-center .note}

$$
    C(Q) = Q^{2} + 10
$$

. . .

$$
    C(0) = 0^{2} + 10 = 10
$$

---

## Variable Costs (VC)

These are the increasing costs that the firm pays [for every unit of quantity produced]{.hi}

- [These are costs of producing $Q$, when we ignore all Fixed Costs]{.hi}

\begin{align*}
    TC(Q) &= VC + FC \\
    VC &= TC(Q) - FC
\end{align*}

. . . 

<br>
[Find the Variable Costs for the following Cost Function](https://wheelofnames.com/){.h .align-center .note}

$$
    C(Q) = Q^{2} + 10
$$

. . .

$$
    VC = Q^{2}
$$

---

## Decomposing Costs

It is always the case that 

$$ 
    C(Q) = VC(Q) + FC
$$

Costs will always be the sum of the variable costs and the fixed cost

. . .

Let's practice:

[Decompose the following Cost Function into FC, VC, and MC](https://wheelofnames.com/){.hi .align-center .note}

$$
    C(Q) = \frac{1}{3} Q^{3} - Q^{2} + 2Q + 12
$$

. . . 

[\begin{align*}
    FC &= 12 \\
    VC &= \frac{1}{3} Q^{3} - Q^{2} + 2Q \\
    MC &= Q^{2} - 2Q + 2
\end{align*}]{.tiny}

## Fixed and Variable Costs Example as Table

| Q | Fixed Cost | Variable Cost | Total Cost | Marginal Cost $\frac{\delta C}{\delta Q}|
|---|------------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| 0 | 12         | 0             | 12         | 2             |
| 1 | 12         | 1.33          | 13.33      | 1             |
| 2 | 12         | 2.67          | 14.67      | 2             |
| 3 | 12         | 6             | 18         | 5             |
| 4 | 12         | 13.33         | 25.33      | 10            |
| 5 | 12         | 26.67         | 38.67      | 17            |
