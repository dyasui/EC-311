## Decomposing Costs: Average Costs

Although Total, Variable, and Fixed Costs are important to Cost Functions we do not really care for them on their own

What we care about are the [Average of these costs]{.hi}

. . .

Now we will introduce [Average Costs]{.hi} which are quite literally just the average of the previous costs

## Decomposing Costs: Average Costs 

For the following Cost Function

$$
    C(Q) = Q^{2} + 10 
$$

[Find ATC, AFC, and AVC](https://wheelofnames.com/){.hi .align-center .note}

. . .

\begin{align*}
    ATC = Q + \frac{10}{Q} \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; AFC = \frac{10}{Q} \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; AVC = Q
\end{align*}

## Graphing Cost Functions

Graphing cost functions is very helpful to understanding what is going on and how optimal choices are made

For the Cost Function

$$
    C(Q) = \frac{1}{3}Q^{3} - Q^{2} + 2Q + 12
$$

<br>
We will graph the [MC, AFC, AVC, and ATC]{.hi}

But first we will derive them

## Key Things About Graphing Costs

As always, the scale is not very important

But be sure to get the [most important facts down]{.hi}:

::: {.incremental}
- They are all convex (open upwards)
- [AVC]{.hi} is always below the [ATC]{.hi}
- Where [the curves cross is crucial]{.hi}
    - The [MC]{.hi} crosses the [AVC]{.hi} and [ATC]{.hi} at their [minimum values]{.hi}
- As always, label your curves and axis!

## Importance of Average Total & Marginal Cost Relationship {.smaller}

![](images/mc-equals-atc.png){fig-align="center" height="250"}

What is so special about the point where [MC]{.hi} and [ATC]{.hi} cross?

::: {.incremental}
- It is where the [ATC]{.hi} is at it's minimum value
- Mathematically, this is where the derivative of [ATC $= 0$]{.hi} 
    - This implies that the [MC = ATC]{.hi}

. . .

Let's look at an example that will show us what I mean intuitively

## Average Total & Marginal Cost Relationship

Imagine we measure the height of everyone in class and find the average height

Then someone new joins the class

. . .

What happens to the [average height]{.hi} if the new person is [shorter than the average](https://wheelofnames.com/){.hi}?

::: {.incremental}
- It [decreases]{.hi}

- When the [Marginal Person]{.h} is [shorter than the average]{.hi}, the [average]{.hi} [decreases]{.hi-red}

- When the [Marginal Person]{.h} is [taller than the average]{.hi}, the [average]{.hi} [increases]{.hi-green}
:::

---

## Average Total & Marginal Cost Relationship

At our sweet spot where [MC = ATC]{.hi} at the minimum of the [ATC]{.hi} we can say:

::: {.incremental}
- When the [Marginal Cost]{.hi} is less than the [Average Total Cost]{.hi}, the [ATC]{.hi} must be [decreasing]{.hi-red}
- When the [Marginal Cost]{.hi} is larger than the [Average Total Cost]{.hi}, the [ATC]{.hi} must be [increasing]{.hi-green}

- -> Therefore, when [MC = ATC]{.hi}, the [average total cost]{.hi} is switching from [decreasing]{.hi-red} to [increasing]{.hi-green}

  * That is the definition of a minimum

- All of this will be useful for our next topic: [Profit Maximization]{.hi}
