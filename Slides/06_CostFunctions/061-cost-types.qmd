## Different Types of Costs

So far, we've categorized costs according the *type of input* they go with

- For example, the **wage** is the cost of **labor** inputs
- and the **rental rate** is the cost of **capital** inputs

. . .

You may also recall the difference between what economists call [accounting costs]{.h} and [opportunity costs]{.h}

## Economic Cost

The [economic costs]{.h} faced by anyone is the sum these two:

:::{.callout-tip}
### Accounting Cost:
The costs you most typically think of: the sticker price you physically pay.
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
### Opportunity Cost:
The opportunity cost of something is the value of the next best use of the materials you put into it.
:::

. . .

- E.g., your [opportunity cost]{.h} of you being in class today might be the lost value of not being out in the sun instead.

## Opportunity Cost

Let's consider of a non-economics example [Kyler Murray]{.hi}

## Scaling up Production

Last week we looked at the production function for UO Dining:

$$f(K,L) = L\cdot K = 900 \text{ lunches}$$

We solved the [cost-minimzation problem]{.h} when the wage was \$16 and the rental rate was \$25:

$$
\begin{align}
L^*(w=16,r=25,Q=900) &= 37.5 \\
K^*(w=16,r=25,Q=900) &= 24
\end{align}
$$

:::{.incremental}
- What happens if UO dining wants to double its production?
- Would they need double the amount of $K$ and $L$?

## What Are Returns to Scale?

[Returns to Scale]{.hi} will measure the following:

If I [increase my inputs by equal amounts (such that labor and capital increase by some constant $z$)]{.h}, how much does my [output increase by]{.h}?

. . .

There are three possible outcomes:

::: {.incremental}
- Decreasing Returns to Scale (DRS)
- Constant Returns to Scale (CRS)
- Increasing Returns to Scale (IRS)
:::

---

## Returns to Scale Example

If UO dining doubles their inputs, how much output would they get?

$$f(2\cdot K^*, 2\cdot L^*) = ?$$

:::{.incremental}
- $f(2\cdot 24, 2\cdot 37.5) = (48)\cdot(75) = 3600$
- $f(2\cdot 24, 2\cdot 37.5) = 3600 > 2\cdot f(24,37.5) = 1800$
- So $f(.)$ experiences [increasing returns to scale]{.h}
:::

---

## Returns to Scale: Mathematically

As usual, we can show these concepts mathematically

::: {.fragment}
- [Decreasing Returns to Scale]{.hi .align-center}

$$
    F(zL,zK) > z \cdot F(L,K)
$$
:::

::: {.fragment}
- [Constant Returns to Scale]{.hi .align-center}

$$
    F(zL,zK) = z \cdot F(L,K)
$$
:::

::: {.fragment}
- [Increasing Returns to Scale]{.hi .align-center}

$$
    F(zL,zK) < z \cdot F(L,K)
$$
:::

## Long-Run Cost Functions

In the long-run, UO Dining could target any level of production and be able to adjust *both* $K$ and $L$.

- Let's think about the LR total cost function as a function of the chosen quota:

$$
\begin{align}
C^*(Q) = & \text{min } wL + rK \\
& s.t. L\cdot K = Q
\end{align}
$$

. . .

- Or, equivalently: $C^*(Q) = wL^* + rK^*$

---

## Long-Run Cost Functions

UO's LR cost function can be derived by setting $MRTS_{L,K}$ equal to $\frac{w}{r}$:

$$\frac{K}{L}=\frac{w}{r}$$

And then plugging the ratio of $K=\frac{w}{r}L$ into $f()$:

$$
\begin{align}
(\frac{w}{r}L)\cdot L & = Q & \Rightarrow L^* & = \sqrt{\frac{r}{w}Q} \\
& & \Rightarrow K^* & = \sqrt{\frac{w}{r}Q}
\end{align}
$$

So we get the LR total cost function:

$$
C^*(Q) = 2\sqrt{wrQ}
$$

## Long-Run Cost Functions

It's okay if you don't follow all the math at first!

But let's try to use these functions to visualize what's going on:
