## Competing by Quantity & Timing

Imagine a Farmer's Market. Here you have a stand that sells flowers

::: {.incremental}
- The competing flower stand next to you always shows up 30 minutes before you do

- By the time you arrive, they have already got their flower displays set up
    - Their choice can vary on whether they display a large amount of flowers (which depresses market price) or put up a small display (which keeps market price high)

## Stackelberg Competition - Structure

We remain with only two firms

::: {.incremental}
- We now have a ["Leader"]{.hi-red} and a ["Follower"]{.hi-teal}

- We call this a [Sequential Game]{.hi}

- To solve a [Sequential Game]{.hi}, we first figure out how the [Follower]{.hi-teal} will behave

- We use that information to figure out what the [Leader]{.hi-red} does

## Game Theory Concept - Backwards Induction

This process of working backwards is called [Backwards Induction]{.hi-orange}

But why solve the Stackelberg Model this way?

::: {.incremental}
- When the [Leader]{.hi-red} is considering how much quantity to produce, they are trying to predict how the [Follower]{.hi-teal} will respond
- The [Follower]{.hi-teal} is just reacting to an observed choice
- So we start by figuring out how a [Follower]{.hi-teal} reacts to any choice and then let the [Leader]{.hi-red} make a choice in anticipation of this reaction
