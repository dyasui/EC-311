## Competing by Quantity & Timing

Imagine a Farmer's Market. Here you have a stand that sells flowers

::: {.incremental}
- The competing flower stand next to you always shows up 30 minutes before you do

- By the time you arrive, they have already got their flower displays set up
    - Their choice can vary on whether they display a large amount of flowers (which depresses market price) or put up a small display (which keeps market price high)

## Stackelberg Competition - Structure

We remain with only two firms

::: {.incremental}
- We now have a ["Leader"]{.hi-red} and a ["Follower"]{.hi-teal}

- We call this a [Sequential Game]{.hi}

- To solve a [Sequential Game]{.hi}, we first figure out how the [Follower]{.hi-teal} will behave

- We use that information to figure out what the [Leader]{.hi-red} does
:::

---

## Game Theory Concept - Backwards Induction

This process of working backwards is called [Backwards Induction]{.hi-orange}

But why solve the Stackelberg Model this way?

::: {.incremental}
- When the [Leader]{.hi-red} is considering how much quantity to produce, they are trying to predict how the [Follower]{.hi-teal} will respond
- The [Follower]{.hi-teal} is just reacting to an observed choice
- So we start by figuring out how a [Follower]{.hi-teal} reacts to any choice and then let the [Leader]{.hi-red} make a choice in anticipation of this reaction

## The Follower 

We have looked at [Best Response Functions]{.hi-orange} before

::: {.fragment}
- [They are the firm's optimal choice of quantity given their competitor's chosen quantity. This is how the follower will behave]{.hi-orange}
:::

---

## The Leader

If the [Follower]{.hi-teal} just reacts to what the [Leader]{.hi-red} does, then what does the [Leader]{.hi-red} do?

::: {.incremental}
- They will maximize their profit with [full knowledge of the follower's]{.hi} [Best Response Function]{.hi-orange}
    - We assume they know it exactly. There are no tricks the [Follower]{.hi-teal} can pull
- They behave similar to a Monopoly, they will plug in [this knowledge]{.hi} into their profit function before maximizing
:::

## Stackelberg Competition - Example

We will grab the same two firms from before, where we already know their [Best Response Functions]{.hi-orange}

Let's also say that [Firm B is the Follower]{.hi-teal} and [Firm A is the Leader]{.hi-red}

::: {.fragment .tiny}
$$
    \text{Firm B Best Response: } Q^{*}_{B} = \frac{100 - Q_{A}}{4} \;\;\;\; ; \;\;\;\; \pi_{A} = (100 - Q_{A} - Q_{B}) Q_{A} - Q^{2}_{A}
$$

[Find Firm A's Profit Function]{.hi .note .align-center}
:::

::: {.fragment}
\begin{align*}
    \pi_{A} = \left(100 - Q_{A} - \color{red}{\frac{100 - Q_{A}}{4}}\right) Q_{A} - Q^{2}_{A}
\end{align*}
:::

## Stackelber - Finding Profit Maximizing Quantity for the Leader

::: {.incremental .tiny}
$$
    \pi_{A} = \left(100 - Q_{A} - \color{red}{\frac{100 - Q_{A}}{4}}\right) Q_{A} - Q^{2}_{A}
$$
:::

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%" .tiny}
[Find $\; \frac{\partial \pi_{A}}{\partial Q_{A}} = 0$]{.hi .align-center}

::: {.fragment .tiny}
$$
    100 - 2Q_{A} - 25 + \frac{Q_{A}}{2} - 2Q_{A} = 0
$$

\begin{align*}
    75 - \frac{3}{2}Q_{A} &= 2Q_{A} \\
    75 &= \frac{7}{2}Q_{A} \\
    150 &= 7Q_{A} \\
    Q^{*}_{A} &\approx 21.5 
\end{align*}
:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.fragment}
[Compare this to what we found in Cournot Competition]{.hi}

We had found that $Q_{A} = 20$

So we have found that the [Leader]{.hi-red} will [produce more]{.hi} than they would have under [Cournot Competition]{.hi}

## Stackelberg - Finding Profit Maximizing Quantity for the Follower {.smaller}

We said that the [Follower]{.hi-teal} will respond using their [Best Response Function]{.hi-orange}

::: {.incremental .small}
$$
    Q^{*}_{B} = \frac{100 - Q^{*}_{A}}{4}
$$
:::

And we just found that $\; Q^{*}_{A} \approx 21.5$

[Find the Follower's Profit Maximizing Quantity]{.hi .note .align-center .small}

::::: {.fragment .small}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
\begin{align*}
    Q^{*}_{B} &= \frac{100 - 21.5}{4} \\
    Q^{*}_{B} &= \frac{78.5}{4} \\
    Q^{*}_{B} &\approx 19.6
\end{align*}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.fragment}
[Compare this to what we found in Cournot Competition]{.hi}

We had found that $Q_{B} = 20$

So we have found that the [Follower]{.hi-teal} will [produce less]{.hi} than they would have under [Cournot Competition]{.hi}

## Stackelberg - Outcomes

[There is a predictable outcome, we can say that relative to the Cournot Competition:]{.hi}

::: {.incremental}
- The [Leader]{.hi-red} will earn [higher profits]{.hi} because they [produce more]{.hi}
- The [Follower]{.hi-teal} will earn [lower profits]{.hi} because they [produce less]{.hi}
:::

. . .

This leads us to the conclusion that

<br>

[Stackelberg Competition features a First-Mover Advantage]{.hi .align-center}

[Being able to go first implies that you can set a higher quantity produced and crowd-out your competition from the market]{.hi .align-center}

---

## Competition Up To Now

All of these previous forms of competition have modeled firms competing [on choosing quantities]{.hi}

- Where the sum of the quantities produced determines the [Market Quantity]{.hi} which determines the [Market Price]{.hi}

. . .

But what if firms can [set prices before they have to produce anything?]{.hi}

- What if firms can compete based on [their choice of Price]{.hi}?

- We call these [Bertrand Competition]{.hi}
