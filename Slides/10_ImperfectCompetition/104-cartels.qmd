## Forming a Cartel {.tiny}

Let's stay with our two firms from earlier. Rather than competing with each other, they decide to [collude]{.hi-purple} and form a [Cartel]{.hi-purple}

The [Cartel's Profits]{.hi-purple} is simply both firm's profit functions summed up

$$
    \pi_{Cartel} = \pi_{A} + \pi_{B}
$$

::: {.fragment .tiny}
Our profits were:

$$
    \pi_{A} = P \cdot Q_{A} - Q_{A}^{2} \;\;\;\;\; \& \;\;\;\;\; \pi_{B} = P \cdot Q_{B} - Q_{B}^{2} \;\;\; ; \;\;\; P = 100 - Q_{S}
$$

## Cartel - Maximize Profits

We maximize profits by taking the derivative with respect to both quantities $(Q_{A} \; \& \; Q_{B})$

$$
    \pi_{Cartel} = (100 - Q_{A} - Q_{B}) \cdot Q_{A} + (100 - Q_{A} - Q_{B}) \cdot Q_{B} - Q_{A}^{2} - Q_{B}^{2}

## Cartel - Maximize Profits (Part 2)

We know 

$$
    Q_{A}^{*} = \frac{100}{6} \;\;\;\;\; \& \;\;\;\;\; Q_{B}^{*} = \frac{100}{6}
$$

Now we can find the [Market Quantity and Market Price]{.hi}

## Cartel Results {.tiny}

The [Cartel]{.hi-purple} produces less than the both [Cournot firms]{.hi} combined and demands a higher price

So basically they managed to create a [Monopoly]{.hi-red} by joining the only two firms in the industry

## Cartel - Joining Both Firms {.tiny}

There is an exception to this approach of combining two firms when we model [Cartel Profits]{.hi-purple}

::: {.fragment}
Imagine two firms with the following [Cost Functions]{.hi}

\begin{align*}
    \text{Firm A: } C(Q_{A}) = 10 \cdot Q_{A} \;\;\;\; ; \;\;\;\; \text{Firm B: } C(Q_{B}) = 5 \cdot Q_{B} 
\end{align*}

[If these firms combine, should we just add their costs together?]{.hi .align-center}

[Think about their Marginal Costs]{.hi .align-center}
:::

::: {.fragment}
\begin{align*}
    \text{Firm A Marginal Costs: } MC = 10 \\ \\
    \text{Firm B Marginal Costs: } MC = 5
\end{align*}

They have different constant marignal costs

::: {.incremental}
- So it will always be cheaper to produce goods using only Firm B
:::

:::

---

## Cartel - The Exception

If we have two firms, both with [Constant Marginal Costs that are Different]{.hi}:

::: {.incremental}
- To form a [Cartel]{.hi-purple}, they will simply shut down the firm with the [Higher Marginal Costs]{.hi} and the other firm will become a [Monopolist]{.hi-red}

- If you were to find profits for both firms in the [Cartel]{.hi-purple} you would see that they are higher for both firms than in [Cournot Competition]{.hi}
:::

::: {.fragment}
[So why not form Cartels then?]{.hi .align-center}

::: {.incremental}
- They are usually illegal
- And more importantly, they are not stable!
:::

## Cartels Are Unstable

Let's jump back to our gas station example

::: {.incremental}
- You and your competitor have a backroom agreement to sell your gas at $5.00/gallon

- The next day you see your "new business partner" posting a price of $5.00/gallon, what are you tempted to do?

- Post a price of $4.99/gallon!
:::

::: {.fragment}
In other words, if you follow through with your [Cartel Agreement]{.hi-purple}

<br>

[It is not your best response for you to follow through also!]{.hi .align-center}
:::

## Cartels - Showing Instability

Jumping back to our [Courtot/Cartel]{.hi} example

The firms split $Q = 100/3$ equally, so $Q_{B} = 100/6$

What is Firm A's [Best Response]{.hi-orange} to $Q_{B} = 100/6$

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.fragment}
From the [Cournot Best Response Functions]{.hi-orange} earlier we have:

<br><br>

\begin{align*}
    Q_{A}^{*} &= \frac{100 - Q_{B}}{4} = 25 - \frac{Q_{B}}{4}
\end{align*}
:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.fragment .small}
[If we plug in $\; Q_{B} \;$ we get:]{.align-center .hi}

\begin{align*}
    Q_{A}^{*} &= 25 - \frac{Q_{B}}{4} \\
    Q_{A}^{*} &= 25 - \frac{\color{red}{\frac{100}{6}}}{4} \\
    Q_{A}^{*} &= 25 - \frac{25}{6} \\ 
    Q_{A}^{*} &\approx 21 > \frac{100}{6}
\end{align*}
:::

## Cartel - Instability

Each firm is tempted to deviate from their [Cartel Agreement]{.hi-purple} and produce more than they agreed to

The firm that deviates will increase their profits

The firm that sticks to the agreement will have lower profits

If both firms deviate from the [Cartel Agreement]{.hi-purple}, then both of them end up with lower profits

---

## Timing Matters

All previous models of quantity competition have firms decide their [Best Responses]{.hi-orange} at the same time, much like playing rock-paper-scissors

We call these [Simultaneous Games]{.hi}

::: {.fragment}
Now we will look at a model that introduces timing
