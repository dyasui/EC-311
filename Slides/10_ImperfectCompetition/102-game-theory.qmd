## Decision-Making Until Now

We have only studied decisions where one person or one firm were making decisions ["in a vacuum"]{.hi} 

- We specifically addressed what is best for the individual or the firm, [but it never depended on what other people or firms do]{.hi}

. . .

[Monopolies]{.hi-red} were slightly different

::: {.incremental}
- They maximized porfits, [while taking into account the behavior of the consumers in their market]{.hi}

    - Our models of [Imperfect Competition]{.hi} are going to look similarly, with some modifications

## Game Theory Basics

Let's think of a simple example to illustrate [Game Theory]{.hi}

. . .

Imagine that you manage a gas station. Directly across the street from you is a competing gas station. Also assume that you are the only stations in town

Both of you set your gas prices at he start of the day and only have two choices: 

. . .

[Set Low Price]{.hi .align-center}

::: {.column width="50%"}
[Set High Price]{.hi .align-center}

[This means there are four possible outcomes we will consider]{.hi .align-center}

[So what should you do?]{.hi .align-center}

## Game Theory - Nash Equilibrium

Let's formalize the thought process [Game Theory]{.hi} indicates

Imagine that your competitor chooses to set a [High Price]{.hi}. How should you respond?

::: {.incremental}
- You can take the entire market and earn 20 by setting a [Low Price]{.hi}
- This is clearly better than setting a [High Price]{.hi} and sharing the market earning 15
:::

::: {.fragment}

Now imagine the competitor chose to set a [Low Price]{.hi}. How should you respond?

::: {.incremental}
- If you do not set a [Low Price]{.hi}, your competitor will take the entire market and you will earn 0
- Your best response is to also set a [Low Price]{.hi} and earn 10
:::

## Game Theory - Nash Equilibrium

Regardless of what your competitor does, the best thing for you to do is to set a [Low Price]{.hi}

::: {.incremental}
- Now if you switch perspectives and answer the same questions from your competitor's point of view [You will get the same answer]{.hi}
- So both of you are responding as you best could, to each other's best decision
:::

::: {.fragment}
[This outcome is called a]{.hi .align-center}

[Nash Equilibrium]{.hi-orange .align-center}

## Nash Equilibrium

I will abbreviate [Nash Equilibrium]{.hi-orange} as [NE]{.hi-orange}
Let's define it formally

A set of choices (one for each player) is a [NE]{.hi-orange} if:

::: {.incremental}
- Each player's choice maximized their payoff [given the choice of the other player]{.hi-orange}
- Note that the [NE]{.hi-orange} is not the outcome that maximizes the [total payoffs]{.hi} earned by each player
    - If both gas stations had set a [High Price]{.hi} they would have each earned 15 for a total of 30
    - With the outcome we get, both set a [Low Price]{.hi} and earn 10 each for a total of 20
:::

## Nash Equilibrium 

The term [Best Responding]{.hi-orange} is a grat way of thinking about [NE]{.hi-orange} because it sets us up well for integrating it into our model of firm behavior

::: {.incremental}
- [Firm A]{.hi-red} an come up with a [Best Response]{.hi-orange} to any price that their competitor might set
- In turn, their competitor, [Firm B]{.hi-bb} can also come up with a [Best Response]{.hi-orange} strategy to any price that [Firm A]{.hi-red} might set
- The prices at which [Both Firms are simultaneously best responding to one another are the Nash Equilibrium Prices]{.hi}
:::

## Nash Equilibrium in Producer Markets

To put this in terms of our models where firms maximize profit based on their choice of [Quantity $Q$]{.hi}:

::: {.incremental}
- The [quantities]{.hi} at which [both firms are simultaneously best responding to one another are the Nash Equilibrium quantities]{.hi-orange}
- The [Market Price]{.hi} is determined by [the Sum of the Quantitites]{.hi}
