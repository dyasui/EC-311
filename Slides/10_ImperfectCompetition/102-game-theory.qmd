## Decision-Making Until Now

We have only studied decisions where one person or one firm were making decisions ["in a vacuum"]{.hi} 

- We specifically addressed what is best for the individual or the firm, [but it never depended on what other people or firms do]{.hi}

. . .

[Monopolies]{.hi-red} were slightly different

::: {.incremental}
- They maximized porfits, [while taking into account the behavior of the consumers in their market]{.hi}

    - Our models of [Imperfect Competition]{.hi} are going to look similarly, with some modifications

## Game Theory Basics

Let's think of a simple example to illustrate [Game Theory]{.hi}

. . .

Imagine that you manage a gas station. Directly across the street from you is a competing gas station. Also assume that you are the only stations in town

Both of you set your gas prices at he start of the day and only have two choices: 

. . .

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
[Set Low Price]{.hi .align-center}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
[Set High Price]{.hi .align-center}

:::

::::

<br>

::: {.fragment}
[This means there are four possible outcomes we will consider]{.hi .align-center}
