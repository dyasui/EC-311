## Up To Now

So far we have talked about [Perfect Competition]{.hi-green} and [Monopoly]{.hi-red}

::: {.incremental}
- These firms are either [complete price takers]{.hi-green} or [complete price setters]{.hi-red}
- But these are the extremes, the real world is more nuanced
    - Neither of our models are likely to be truly realistic, but they do a good job at showing us the ends of our [Competitive Spectrum]{.hi}

## Markets

Most markets are somewhere in-between

::: {.incremental}
- Firms cannot set market prices by themselves
- But there are circumstances where there are large firms and are few enough that one single firms choice can impact market prices

. . .

This is the basics of [Imperfect Competition]{.hi} and what we will be tackling until the end

## Imperfect Competition

Firms are still competing but they know who their rivals are and will adopt strategies based on what they think their rivals will do

::: {.incremental .small}
- In order to model firms in these contexts, we need to learn the very basics about [Game Theory]{.hi}
    - This is the field of decision-making in situations where actions affect others' outcomes and vice-versa
- We will keep things simple by only studying interactions between two firms
    - We call this a [Duopoloy]{.hi}
- The intuition and approach we will take holds for cases where there are more than 2 firms
    - This is called an [Oligopoly]{.hi}
