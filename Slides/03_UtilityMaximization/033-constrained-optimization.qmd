## How to Tackle This Mathematically

We know the steps:

::: {.incremental}
1. Calculate the MRS of a given utility function

2. Calculate the Price Ratio using the Budget Constraint

3. Set them equal to each other

## Defining the Problem

The problem will take the form of 

$$\max \; U(x,y) \;\;\;\; \text{subject to} \;\;\;\; P_{x} \cdot x + P_{y} \cdot y = M$$

. . .

This is what we call a [Constrained Optimization]{.hi} problem 

- You are trying to maximize your utility subject to a budget constraint

## Different Utility Functional Forms

We had four different forms that utility can take:

. . .

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Cobb-Douglas

- Quasi-linear

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Perfect Substitutes

- Perfect Complements 

:::

. . .

Each have their quirks and procedure to follow

## Cobb-Douglas Utility Constrained Maximization

There is a 4-step approach that we will follow to solve these problems when the utility function is [Cobb-Douglas]{.hi}

. . .

::: {.incremental}
1. Calculate the MRS and set it equal to the Price Ratio

2. Re-arrange this equality to isolate one good ($x$ or $y$) as a function of the other (It does not matter which good you choose here). 

    - The resulting equation is called an "optimality condition"

3. Write down your budget constraint and plug the optimality condition into it. 

    - This allows you to solve for the [demand]{.hi} of one of the two goods

4. Use your demand for one good and plug it into either the optimality condition or the BC to find the demand for the other good

## 1 - Calculate MRS and Set Equal to Price Ratio

$$\text{Let } \, U(x,y) = xy, \; P_{x} = 1, \; P_{y} = 2, \; M = 12$$

. . .

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Find MRS

::: {.fragment}
$$MRS = \dfrac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}} = \dfrac{y}{x}$$
:::

::: 

::: {.column width="50%"}

Find Price Ratio

::: {.fragment}
$$\text{Price Ratio} = \dfrac{P_{x}}{P_{y}} = \dfrac{1}{2}$$
:::

:::

::::

Set them equal to each other

. . .

$$\dfrac{y}{x} = \dfrac{1}{2}$$

---

## 2 - Re-arrange the Equality to Isolate for One Good

$$\dfrac{y}{x} = \dfrac{1}{2}$$

You can isolate either $x$ or $y$

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Isolating $y$

::: {.fragment}
$$y = \dfrac{x}{2}$$
:::

::: 

::: {.column width="50%"}

Isolating $x$

::: {.fragment}
$$x = 2y$$
:::

:::

::::

. . .

These are optimality conditions for $x$ and $y$

They tell us the demand of a good conditional on other model parameters

---

## 3 - Write Down BC and Plug An Optimality Condition

$$y = \dfrac{x}{2} \;\; \& \;\; BC: \, x + 2y = 12$$

Here I will plug in my known value of $y$ anywhere I find a $y$ in the BC

. . .

\begin{align*}
    x + 2y &= 12 \\
    x + 2(\dfrac{x}{2}) &= 12 \\
    x + x &= 12 \\
    2x &= 12 \\
    x^{*} &= 6
\end{align*}

> [Note: I will denote the optimal amount for any good as $x^{*}$ or $y^{*}$ or whatever variable the problem uses]{.h .note}

---

## 4 - Plug Demand for One Good into Optimality Condition or BC

$$\text{We found that } x^{*} = 6$$

I'll do it both ways just to show you that it works but you only have to do one (I recommend finding which one is simpler for you):

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

[Plugging into Optimality Condition]{.hi}

::: {.fragment}
\begin{align*}
    y &= \dfrac{x^{*}}{2} \\
    y &= \dfrac{6}{2} \\
    y^{*} &= 3
\end{align*}
:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

[Plugging into Budget Constraint]{.hi}

::: {.fragment}
\begin{align*}
    x^{*} + 2y &= 12 \\
    6 + 2y^{*} &= 12 \\
    2y^{*} &= 6 \\
    y^{*} &= 3
\end{align*}

## Cobb-Douglas 2: Example For You

$$U(x,y) = x^{1/4}y^{3/4}, \; P_{x} = 2, \; P_{y} = 3, \; M = 32$$

[What are the optimal amounts of $x$ and $y$ to maximize this individual's utility subject to their budget constraint?]{.h .note}

::: {.fragment}
$$x^{*} = 4 \; \& \; y^{*} = 8$$
:::

[What utility level $U^{*}$ is achieved?]{.h .note}

::: {.fragment}
$$U^{*} = (x^{*})^{1/4} (y^{*})^{3/4} = (4)^{1/4} (8)^{3/4} = \ldots$$
:::

---

## Cobb-Douglas 2: Solution {.smaller}

$$MRS = \dfrac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}} = \dfrac{1/4 \, x^{-3/4} y^{3/4}}{3/4 \, x^{1/4} y^{-1/4}} = \dfrac{1/4}{3/4} \cdot \dfrac{y^{3/4} y^{1/4}}{x^{1/4} x^{3/4}} = \dfrac{1}{3} \cdot \dfrac{y}{x}$$

. . .

Also recall:

$$MRS = \dfrac{a}{b} \cdot \dfrac{y}{x} = \dfrac{1/4}{3/4} \cdot \dfrac{y}{x} = \dfrac{1}{3} \cdot \dfrac{y}{x}$$

. . .

$$\text{Price Ratio} = \dfrac{P_{x}}{P_{y}} = \dfrac{2}{3}$$

. . .

$$\dfrac{y}{3x} = \dfrac{2}{3} \; \rightarrow \; y = 2x$$

. . .

## Quasi-linear Utility Constrained Optimization

To solve problems with this utility functional form we repeat the same steps as C-D but we skip step 3

::: {.incremental}
1. Find the MRS and set it equal to the Price Ratio

2. Solve the equality for the non-linear good (usually inside the $ln()$)

3. Use the BC to find the demand of the other good
:::

---

## 1 - Find the MRS and set it equal to the Price Ratio

$$\text{Let } \, U(x,y) = 10 \cdot ln(x) + \dfrac{y}{2}, \; P_{x} = 5, \; P_{y} = 2, \; M = 70$$

. . .

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Find MRS

::: {.fragment}
$$MRS = \dfrac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}} = \dfrac{10/x}{1/2} = \dfrac{20}{x}$$

::: {.column width="50%"}

Find Price Ratio

::: {.fragment}
$$\text{Price Ratio} = \dfrac{P_{x}}{P_{y}} = \dfrac{5}{2}$$
:::

:::

::::

Set them equal to each other

. . .

$$\dfrac{20}{x} = \dfrac{5}{2}$$

---

## 2 - Solve the Equality for the Non-linear good

$$\dfrac{20}{x} = \dfrac{5}{2}$$

We solve for x (notice there is no $y$)

. . .

\begin{align*}
    40 &= 5x \\
    x^{*} = 8
\end{align*}

---

## 3 - Use BC to Find Demand of Other Good 

$$\text{BC: } 5x + 2y = 70, \;\; x^{*} = 8$$

. . .

\begin{align*}
    5x^{*} + 2y &= 70 \\
    5(8) + 2y &= 70 \\
    40 + 2y &= 70 \\
    2y &= 70 \\
    y^{*} &= 35
\end{align*}

---

## Perfect Substitutes Constrained Optimization 

Recall the functional form

$$U(x,y) = ax + by$$

::: {.incremental}
- Mathematically, the MRS will just equal a constant $\left(\dfrac{a}{b} \right)$ so setting it equal to the price ratio doesn't really do much

- It will either be larger than, smaller than, or equal

- So what do we do? A graph will help us see

Here, the individual chooses to only consume good $x$ and no $y$. Why?

::: {.incremental}
- The [ICs]{.hi-purple} are steeper than the [BC]{.hi-orange}

- The intuition is saying that the [willingness to trade]{.h} $y$ for $x$ is always larger than the [ability to trade]{.h} 

- This individual will get all the $x$ they can!

## Perfect Substitutes Optimization 

As we saw, maximization problems with P-Subs functional form have two predictable outcomes

- Either you consume all $x$ and no $y$ or all $y$ and no $x$

    - It depends on the relationship between the MRS and the Price Ratio

. . .

- There is the unusual case where the slopes are the same

    - Graphically, this means that they will perfectly overlap 

    - Mathematically, any bundle that meets the requirements will work

---

## Perfect Substitutes Utility Constrained Optimization 

The graphs we just saw tell us how to do the math:

::: {.incremental}
1. Find the MRS and Price Ratio

2. Compare the MRS to the Price Ratio
    - If $\text{MRS} > \text{Price Ratio}$, consume all $x$ and $y$ = 0
    - If $\text{MRS} < \text{Price Ratio}$, consume all $y$ and $x$ = 0

3. Figure out how much $x$ and $y$ to consume using the BC
:::

## P-Subs Example (Mathematically)

$$U(x,y) = 3x + 2y, \; P_{x} = 1, \; P_{y} = 4, \; M = 60$$

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Find MRS and Price Ratio

::: {.fragment}
\begin{align*}
    MRS &= \dfrac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}} = \dfrac{3}{2} \\
    \text{Price Ratio} &= \dfrac{P_{x}}{P_{y}} = \dfrac{1}{4}
\end{align*}
:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

Compare MRS to Price ratio

::: {.fragment}
\begin{align*}
    \dfrac{3}{2} &> \dfrac{1}{4} \\
    \text{MRS} &> \text{Price Ratio}
\end{align*}

[Choose only $x$]{.hi}
:::

:::

::::

Figure out how much $x$ and $y$ to consume using the BC 

. . .

\begin{align*}
    \text{BC: } x + 4y &= 60 \\
    x + 4(0) &= 60 \\
    x^{*} &= 60 \\
    y^{*} &= 0
\end{align*}

## Perfect Substitutes Optimization Intuition 

With Perfect Substitutes the goods do not interact at all 

So the question really becomes:

. . .

- Which of these two goods is more cost-effective at generating utility?

. . .   

<br> 

When you say that the MRS is less than the Price Ratio, you are also saying that [**you get fewer units of utility per dollar spent on $x$ than per dollar spent on $y$**]{.hi}. Therefore, you should only consume $y$.

> [**Note: This logic only works for Perfect Substitutes. This is because the MRS is always a constant**]{.h .note}
