## Math Makes Point C special

This is the point where the BC line and the IC curve have the exact same slope, this is also known as [the point where they are tangent]{.h}

. . .

This helps us put the intuition we gained from the graph together with the math

. . .

<br> 

> [**The key to finding the utility maximizing bundle (the best mix of $x$ and $y$) you have to find the bundle where the BC and IC have the same slope**]{.h .note}

---

## Why Does This Work? 
Let's recall what the [Slope of the IC]{.hi} means:

. . .

- It is the **Negative MRS** 

- It tells you how much $y$ you would be [willing to]{.hi} give up to get another unit of $x$?

. . .

Now recall what the [Slope of the BC]{.hi} means:

. . .

- It is the **Negative Price Ratio**

- It tells you how much $y$ you would [have to]{.hi} give up to get another unit of $x$?

## Why Does This Work? {.smaller}

Imagine what it would it mean if these two slopes were not equal

. . .

You are consuming Bundle A where:

The [Negative MRS]{.hi} is $-4$

::: {.incremental}
- What does this mean? 

    - [**You are WILLING to**]{.hi} give up 4 units of $y$ for 1 unit of $x$
:::

. . .

Let's also say that the [Negative Price Ratio]{.hi} is $-3$

::: {.incremental}
- What does this mean?

    - [**You HAVE to**]{.hi} give up 3 units of $y$ for 1 unit of $x$
::: 

. . .

Because it is "cheaper" to trade $y$ for $x$ than you are willing to, you will make the trade

. . .

::: {.notes}    
Lots of non-rhetorical questions at each pause
:::

## Why Does This Work?

If [$\text{Negative MRS } \neq \text{ Price Ratio}$]{.hi} then you trade that bundle for another, which means that you were [**not**]{.h} at a utility maximizing bundle

. . .

<br>

The logic here is:

- [If you willingly move away from a chosen bundle, then that bundle, by definition, cannot be utility maximizing]{.hi .note}

. . . 

Let's draw it!

## Graph Takeaway {.smaller}

. . .

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

If [$\text{Negative MRS } < \text{ Price Ratio}$]{.hi} [**(Point A)**]{.h .note}

::: {.fragment}
- Graphically, this means that the [IC]{.hi} is [**steeper than**]{.h} the [BC]{.hi}

- Trading away some $y$ for some $x$ moves you down and to the right in the better-than set
::: 

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

If [$\text{Negative MRS } > \text{ Price Ratio}$]{.hi} [**(Point B)**]{.h .note}

::: {.fragment}
- Graphically, this means that the [IC]{.hi} is [**flatter than**]{.h} the [BC]{.hi}

- Trading away some $x$ for some $y$ moves you up and to the left in the better-than set

## Graph Takeaway - Part II {.smaller}

The graph implicitly says:

::: {.incremental}
- There are an infinite number of ICs that all correspond to different levels of utility 

- There is only one BC 

- Utility maximization happens [only]{.h} when you find the point on the BC that touches the highest possible IC (once)
:::

## Slope Logic Summary

The logic takaways here are:

::: {.incremental}
- When you have a curved IC, you have to set the slope of the IC equal to the slope of the BC to find the utility-maximizing bundle

- If they are not equal, you would be willing to make some trade to a different bundle

- The magical point of maximization only occurs if the ICs are [Non-Crossing]{.h}, [Monotonic]{.h}, and [Convex]{.h}

    - The [weakly monotonic]{.h} and [weakly convex]{.h} arguments we saw satisfy this

- Most importantly, [**there is only one magical point**]{.hi}
