## Putting All We've Seen Together

So far we have done 3 things:

. . .

1. We learned about measuring and analyzing benefit functions, which we called [Utility]{.h}

. . .

2. We learned about measuring and analyzing cost functions, we called those [Budgets]{.h}

. . .

3. We motivated the importance of "Constrained Optimization"

. . .

Now we will put it all together to solve problems

## Gameplan

We will do it by:

1. Solving it graphically to gain the intuition of what is happening

2. Mathematically, because we need to be able to solve these problems formally

. . .

The core question we are attempting to answer is

> [**Given a specific budget constraint, what bundle should an individual choose to maximize their utility?**]{.h}
