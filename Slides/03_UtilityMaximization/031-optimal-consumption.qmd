## Putting All We've Seen Together

So far we have done 3 things:

. . .

1. We learned about measuring and analyzing benefit functions, which we called [Utility]{.h}

. . .

2. We learned about measuring and analyzing cost functions, we called those [Budgets]{.h}

. . .

3. We motivated the importance of "Constrained Optimization"

. . .

Now we will put it all together to solve problems

---

## Gameplan

We will do it by:

1. Solving it graphically to gain the intuition of what is happening

2. Mathematically, because we need to be able to solve these problems formally

. . .

The core question we are attempting to answer is

<br>

> [**Given a specific budget constraint, what bundle should an individual choose to maximize their utility?**]{.h}

## BC + IC Graph

![](Images\Indifference-Curve.png)

::::

These are our two ingredients to solving a utility maximization problem

## Putting It Together

![](Images\Utility-Max-Graph1.png){fig-align="center"}

The key for these graphs is to internalize the fact that there are infinite amounts of IC we can draw

. . . 

> [**And only one will be utility maximizing bundle**]{.note .h}

## Putting It Together {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}

![](Images\Utility-Max-Graph2.png){fig-align="center"}

Which one is the utility maximizing bundle?

:::

::: {.column width="30%"}

[**Point A**]{.h} 

:::: {.fragment}
Affordable and on the Budget Line
::::

[**Point B**]{.h}

:::: {.fragment}

Affordable but does not use all our budget

::::

[**Point C**]{.h}

:::: {.fragment}
Affordable and on the Budget Line
::::

[**Point D**]{.h}

:::: {.fragment}
Highest utility but unaffordable 
::::

:::

::::

. . .

[**Point C**]{.h} is the highest level of indifference curve that is on the budget line only once!

## BC + IC Graph Takeaways

ICs [above]{.hi} the BC:

:::: {.fragment}
- If the IC [never touches the budget constraint]{.hi}, then none of the bundles on that curve (that utility level) are affordable 
:::: 

:::: {.fragment}
- It is impossible to achieve that level of utility with the given amount of income
::::

ICs [below]{.hi} the BC:

:::: {.fragment}
- If the IC is [within the bounds of the BC]{.hi}, it is possible to attain that level of utility with the given amount of income
::::

:::: {.fragment}
- It is also possible to attain more utility than the level given by this IC and still use less than the given income
::::

## IC With The Highest Utility 

![](Images\Utility-Max-Graph2.png){fig-align="center"}

[**Point C**]{.h} is a magical point

- It is where the IC touches the BC [exactly once]{.hi}

- Every other point on the [green IC]{.hi-green} is unaffordable 

---

## IC With The Highest Utility 

![](Images\Utility-Max-Graph2.png){fig-align="center"}

- We call [**Point C**]{.h} the [Utility Maximizing Bundle]{.hii}

- Moving along the BC, to other affordable bundles like [**Point A**]{.h} only makes you worse off

. . .

But what is so special about [**Point C**]{.h}? Math does!
