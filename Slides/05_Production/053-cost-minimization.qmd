## Assumption 3: Cost Minimization

Instead of trying to *maximize production*, firms try to *minimize costs* while trying to meet a specific level of production.

$$
\begin{align}
min & w \cdot L + r \cdot K \\
\text{subject to } & f(K,L) = Q \\ 
\end{align}
$$

. . .

- Notice how this is the flip side of the constrained *maximization* problem?

## Setting Cost-Minimization

What are some questions we could ask using the math tools we have learned?

::: {.incremental}
- What combinations of *inputs* produce the same quantity of output

- How do firm's choose to *substitute* one input for another?

- How do changes in *input costs* affect production?
:::

## Isoquants

What do these production functions look like graphically?

- [isoquants]{.h} are sets of bundles of inputs that produce the same level of output

- Visually similar to *indifference curves*, but conceptually different

## Isoquants

## Marginal Products

How much does one more worker (or unit of input) contribute towards production?

$$MP_L = \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta L}$$

$$MP_K = \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta K}$$

## Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution

How many units of capital would the firm have to give up to use one more worker,
**when holding output constant** 

$$MRTS_{LK} = \frac{MP_L}{MP_K}$$

## Production Function Example

[Identify and find the MRTS for the following Production Function]{.hi .note .align-center}

$$
    F(L,K) = L^{1/3}K^{2/3}
$$

. . . 

<br>

$$
    \text{MRTS} = \frac{MP_{L}}{MP_{K}} = \frac{1/3 \cdot L^{-2/3}K^{2/3}}{2/3 \cdot L^{1/3}K^{-1/3}} = \frac{1/3}{2/3} \cdot \frac{K^{2/3}K^{1/3}}{L^{1/3}L^{2/3}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{K}{L}
$$

## Relationships Between Inputs

Apply the concepts of [substitute]{.hi} and [complement]{.hi} goods from *consumer* theory to production:

- Can you name two inputs which could be [perfect substitutes]{.h} in production?

- What about [perfect complements]{.h}?

- Some inputs with both substitution and complementarities?


## Production Function Forms

We have the exact same functional forms that we used for utility functions

This is good news! It means that mathematically nothing should be suprising

We are just relabeling variables and using the same processes we already know

--- 

## Icocosts

How do we describe all input combinations that cost the same to the firm?

$$C = RK + WL$$

- $R$ is the [rental rate]{.h} of capital
- $W$ is the [wage rate]{.h} paid to workers

## Firm Optimization Story Time

Imagine you are the manager of a clothing factory that produces Ducks football jerseys

It is almost Fall and Mr. Nike himself calls you. They tell you ["We need 20,000 jerseys made for the start of the season"]{.hii}

. . .

<br> 

Your goal is to choose how many [workers $(L)$]{.h} and how much [capital $(L)$]{.h} to use to produce the 20,000 jerseys as cheaply as possible

> How do you figure out how to use $L$ and $K$ to make 20,000 jerseys? 
>
> [With a Production Function]{.h .align-center}

---

## Production Functions

These are a function of how a firm can transform [inputs]{.hi} into [outputs]{.hi}

It will work just like a utility function

- In our the jersey example, we have:

\begin{align*}
    F(L,K) &= Q \\
    F(L,K) &= 20,000
\end{align*}

---

## Putting it Together

The problem the factory manager solves can be written as 

$$
    \min \;\; w \cdot L + r \cdot K \;\;\; s.t. \;\;\; F(L,K) = Q = 20,000
$$

. . .

We can read this as:

- The firm minimizes their [costs ($w \cdot L + r \cdot K$)]{.hi} such that you produce a given [quantity $(Q)$]{.hi} using [labor $(L)$ and capital $(K)$]{.hi} with [Production Technology $F(L,K)$]{.hi}

---

## Let's Give Things Some Values 

Now let's say we have the following values:

- Wages are $w = 10$
- Rental rates are $r = 5$
- The factory's Production Function is $F(L,K) = 5L + 2K$

. . .

<br> 
The problem becomes:

$$
    \min \;\; 10L + 5K \;\;\; s.t. \;\;\; F(L,K) = 5L + 2K = 20,000
$$  

## Solving Cost Minimization Problems - New Terms {.smaller}

The methods to solve these problems are practically the same as we saw in Consumer Theory

However, we need to re-label some things:

::: {.incremental}
- The Marginal Rate of Substitution will not be named [Marginal Rate of Technological Substitution (MRTS)]{.hi}
    - This has a similar interpretation as before: 
        - [What is the firm's willingness to trade Labor for Capital]{.hi}
- Now, instead of using the ratio of marginal utilities, we will use the [ratio of marginal productivities]{.hi}
:::

. . . 

$$
    \text{MRTS} = \frac{MP_{L}}{MP_{K}} = \frac{\frac{\partial F}{\partial L}}{\frac{\partial F}{\partial K}} = \frac{\text{Marginal Productivity of Labor}}{\text{Marginal Productivity of Capital}}
$$

## Let's Solve the Jersey Problem {.smaller}

$$
    \min \;\; 10L + 5K \;\;\; s.t. \;\;\; F(L,K) = 5L + 2K = 20,000
$$  

The solution should look very familiar. We are trying to choose $L^{*}$ and $K^{*}$ that optimizes our productivity.

## What's Actually Different Then?

Although the problem we are solving is essentially the same, the levers we are pulling are not

Let's introduce some new (but familiar) concepts:

::: {.incremental}
- Production Functions have [Isoquants]{.hi} instead of Indifference Curves

- [Isoquants]{.hi} are all the possible combinations of [labor and capital]{.h} that produce a certain level of output

- Fortunately, they have the same shape as their Indifference Curves but instead of a level of Utility, they represent a level of quantity produced
:::

---

## Isoquants

Imagine that it takes exactly 20 minutes of labor (1/3 of an hour) [AND]{.hi} 10 units of capital to make one Ducks Jersey

. . .

[What form does this Production Function take?]{.h .note}

. . .

[Perfect Complements]{.hi .align-center}

![](images/isoquant-perfect-comps.png){fig-align="center" height=350}

---

## What's Actually Different? The Process

The key difference is a conceptual one:

- For consumers, we would [maximize the Utility Function, where the costs acted as our constraint]{.hi}

- For producers, we [minimize the cost function and the production function is the constraint]{.hi}

    - Additionally, we will call this cost function an [Isocost line]{.hi}

. . .

> [We are looking for the lowest possible Isocost line that touches the production contraint exactly once]{.h .note}

## What is the Same?

Some things have not changed

::: {.incremental}
- The slope of the isoquant is the negative MRTS (-MRTS)
- The MRTS tells us the firm's willingness to trade away capital to get another unit of labor
- We still have a price ratio: $\frac{w}{r}$
