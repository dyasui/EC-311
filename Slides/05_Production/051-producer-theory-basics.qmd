## Production Assumptions

Just like we made simplifying assumptions about *consumers*, we'll need some ground rules for [producers]{.hi}:

::::: {.columns}
:::: {.incremental}
::: {.column width="50%"}
1. Single production good
2. Product choice is fixed
3. Cost minimization
4. Capital is fixed in short-run
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
5. More inputs $\rightarrow$ more outputs
6. Diminishing marginal returns
7. Firm's aren't budget constrained
:::

. . .

I'll tackle each one in a slightly different order, but this is how they appear in the textbook

## Assumption 1: Single Output

In our models, each type of firm only produces one type of good.

- I.e., Shoe companies just produce generic shoes, we don't care about different styles

## Firms: What do They Make? How Do They Make It? Let's Find Out!

Let's determine the role of the firm

::: {.incremental}
- Firms produce [goods (output)]{.hi} to sell consumers

- To produce [output]{.hi}, firms need [factors of production (inputs)]{.hi} such as [labor and capital]{.hi}

- Firms use a [production process (technology)]{.hi} to transform [inputs]{.hi} into [output]{.hi}

## Firm Productivity

How firms choose to produce things is guided by a similar principle to how individuals consume things

. . . 

<br>

[Marginal Productivity]{.hi}

::: {.incremental}
- [The impact of one additional factor of production on the total amount produced]{.h}

- Recall that utility is usually diminishing as consumption increases

- Productivity also diminishes as a firm uses more inputs

## Production Functions

In mathematical language: a [production function]{.h} takes inputs to create a quantity of output:

$$f(x_1,...,x_n) : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$

::: {.incremental}
- Just like *utility functions*, [production functions]{.h} can take multiple inputs
:::

## Production Functions

We will only consieder production with **two** inputs at a time:

$$Q = f(K,L)$$

This production function means that a firm produces $Q$ units of it's output good using:

- $K$: [Captial]{.h} (machines, buildings, computers, etc.)
- $L$: [Labor]{.h} - the human workers who use the capital
  * Units could be in number of workers, labor hours, etc.

## Assumption 2: Product Choice is Fixed

We will assume that all potential producing firms in a market have already decided on their single product.

- We don't consider e.g., Amazon going from ecommerce to cloud services

## Assumption 5: More Inputs -> More Output

For simplicity, we assume that firms can always achieve higher production levels by using more inputs

- $(f(K,L)$ is [monitonically increasing]{.hi} in $K,L$ ($\frac{df}{dK},\frac{df}{dL}>0$)

- similar to our "more is better" assumption of consumer utility

## Assumption 6: Diminishing Returns

More capital and labor always leads to more production,
*but* those gains will fade out the more you have already used

- $\frac{df}{dK^2},\frac{df}{dL^2} < 0$

- If graphed on the *input-product* axes, the production function will be [concave]{.h}.

## The Production Problem

We will begin by making a simplifying assumption to make our lives easier

<br>

Firms will have [2 typical inputs]{.hi}

::: {.incremental}
- [Labor (L)]{.hi} $\Rightarrow$ Workers

    - The cost of a unit of labor is the [wage $(w)$]{.hi} paid

- [Capital (K)]{.hi} $\Rightarrow$ Factory space, equipment, hardware, etc. 

    - The cost of a unit of capital is the [rental rate or interest rate $(r)$]{.hi}

## Formalizing the Production Problem

Similar to the Budget Constraint from Consumer Theory, we can formalize the firm's costs: 

$$
    \text{Costs:} \;\; w \cdot L + r \cdot K 
$$

. . .

<br> 

[Write the costs of a firm that faces a wage of $10 and a rental rate of $12:]{.note .hi .align-center}

. . .

<br> 

$$
   \text{Costs:} \;\; 10 L + 12 K
$$
