## Firms: What do They Make? How Do They Make It? Let's Find Out!

Let's determine the role of the firm

::: {.incremental}
- Firms produce [goods (output)]{.hi} to sell consumers

- To produce [output]{.hi}, firms need [factors of production (inputs)]{.hi} such as [labor and capital]{.hi}

- Firms use a [production process (technology)]{.hi} to transform [inputs]{.hi} into [output]{.hi}

## Firm Productivity

How firms choose to produce things is guided by a similar principle to how individuals consume things

. . . 

<br>

[Marginal Productivity]{.hi}

::: {.incremental}
- [The impact of one additional factor of production on the total amount produced]{.h}

- Recall that utility is usually diminishing as consumption increases

- Productivity also diminishes as a firm uses more inputs

## The Production Problem

We will begin by making a simplifying assumption to make our lives easier

<br>

Firms will have [2 typical inputs]{.hi}

::: {.incremental}
- [Labor (L)]{.hi} $\Rightarrow$ Workers

    - The cost of a unit of labor is the [wage $(w)$]{.hi} paid

- [Capital (K)]{.hi} $\Rightarrow$ Factory space, equipment, hardware, etc. 

    - The cost of a unit of capital is the [rental rate or interest rate $(r)$]{.hi}

## Formalizing the Production Problem

Similar to the Budget Constraint from Consumer Theory, we can formalize the firm's costs: 

$$
    \text{Costs:} \;\; w \cdot L + r \cdot K 
$$

. . .

<br> 

[Write the costs of a firm that faces a wage of $10 and a rental rate of $12:]{.note .hi .align-center}

. . .

<br> 

$$
   \text{Costs:} \;\; 10 L + 12 K
$$
