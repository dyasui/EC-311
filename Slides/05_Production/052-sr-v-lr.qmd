## Assumption 4: Capital is Fixed in the Short-Run

We implicitly define the [short-run]{.h} as the time-span where firms don't have enough time to buy more capital.

- As opposed to the [long-run]{.h} where capital is assumed to be variable

## Assumption 7: Firms aren't Budget Constrained

For the short-run, capital is only constrained by time-frame, not by how much money the firm has.

- In the long-run, the firm can choose any combination of capital *and* labor it wants

- We assume that as long as there is profit to be made, there is a complete credit market that will provide funds

## Example: Nike Waffle Trainers

[Nike founding story: Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/february-26/nike-patent-waffle-sole-trainers-invented-in-waffle-iron)

$$Q_s^{\text{shoes}} = f(\text{waffle irons},\text{workers}) = \sqrt{KL}$$

## Example: Nike Waffle Trainers

Suppose they only have 4 irons to start out with $\bar{K}=4$, but can hire as many workers as I need.

| Irons  | Workers | Shoes Produced          |
|--------|---------|-------------------------|
| 4      | 1       | 2                       |
| 4      | 2       | $\sqrt{8} \approx 2.8$  |
| 4      | 3       | $\sqrt{12} \approx 3.5$ |
| 4      | 4       | 4                       |

. . .

- What do you notice as the number of workers increases?

## Example: Nike Waffle Trainers

The [marginal product of labor]{.h} is decreasing!

| Irons  | Workers | Shoes Produced          | Marginal Product |
|--------|---------|-------------------------|------------------|
| 4      | 0       | 0                       | -                |
| 4      | 1       | 2                       | 2                |
| 4      | 2       | $\sqrt{8} \approx 2.8$  | 0.8              |
| 4      | 3       | $\sqrt{12} \approx 3.5$ | 0.7              |
| 4      | 4       | 4                       | 0.5              |

The next worker adds less and less to the total production the more workers we already have in the kitchen

## Marginal Product of Labor

The [Marginal Product of Labor]{.h} is the change in the quantity of production caused by a change in the quantity of labor as an input.

::: {.incremental}

- Given a production function $f(K,L)$, how could you find an expression which represents this change *for any quantity change* of labor?

- Take the partial derivative $\frac{df}{dL}$ holding capital fixed!

- This is the slope of our [short-run production function]{.h}!

## Average Product of Labor

[Average Product]{.h} is the quantity of output produced *per unit of input*.

$$AP_L = Q/L$$

- The [average product]{.h} is related to the [marginal product]{.h}, 
but not the same

$$AP_L = Q/L$$

## Average Product of Labor

| Irons  | Workers | Shoes Produced          | Marginal Product | Average Product |
|--------|---------|-------------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 4      | 0       | 0                       | -                | -               |
| 4      | 1       | 2                       | 2                | 2               |
| 4      | 2       | $\sqrt{8} \approx 2.8$  | 0.8              | $\approx 1.4$   |
| 4      | 3       | $\sqrt{12} \approx 3.5$ | 0.7              | $\approx 1.2$   |
| 4      | 4       | 4                       | 0.5              | 1               |

## Assumption 4: Capital is Variable in the Long-Run

The flip side of assumption 4: the [Long-Run]{.h} is the time when Capital is not fixed

- Our Long-Run Production Function:

$$Q = f(K,L)$$

- The same as the SR version, but now $K$ is treated as a *variable*, not a *constant*

## Long-Run Production Functions

|       | $L=1$ | $L=2$ | $L=3$ | $L=4$ |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| $K=1$ | 1.00  | 1.41  | 1.73  | 2.00  |
| $K=2$ | 1.41  | 2.00  | 2.45  | 2.83  |
| $K=3$ | 1.73  | 2.45  | 3.00  | 3.46  |
| $K=4$ | 2.00  | 2.83  | 3.46  | 4.00  |

What are some tools we have already learned that will help us analyze *multi-variable functions*?
