## How Do Firms Optimize?

[Instead of maximizing utility, as consumers do, firms will]{.align-center}

[MINIMIZE THEIR COSTS OF PRODUCTION]{.hi .align-center}

. . .

<br><br>

These decisions are also done under a constraint, but what constraints do firms face?

Let's tell a story to see the logic before we jump into the math

---

## Firm Optimization Story Time

Imagine you are the manager of a clothing factory that produces Ducks football jerseys

It is almost Fall and Mr. Nike himself calls you. They tell you ["We need 20,000 jerseys made for the start of the season"]{.hii}

. . .

<br> 

Your goal is to choose how many [workers $(L)$]{.h} and how much [capital $(L)$]{.h} to use to produce the 20,000 jerseys as cheaply as possible

> How do you figure out how to use $L$ and $K$ to make 20,000 jerseys? 
>
> [With a Production Function]{.h .align-center}

---

## Production Functions

These are a function of how a firm can transform [inputs]{.hi} into [outputs]{.hi}

It will work just like a utility function

- In our the jersey example, we have:

\begin{align*}
    F(L,K) &= Q \\
    F(L,K) &= 20,000
\end{align*}

---

## Putting it Together

The problem the factory manager solves can be written as 

$$
    \min \;\; w \cdot L + r \cdot K \;\;\; s.t. \;\;\; F(L,K) = Q = 20,000
$$

. . .

We can read this as:

- The firm minimizes their [costs ($w \cdot L + r \cdot K$)]{.hi} such that you produce a given [quantity $(Q)$]{.hi} using [labor $(L)$ and capital $(K)$]{.hi} with [Production Technology $F(L,K)$]{.hi}

---

## Let's Give Things Some Values 

Now let's say we have the following values:

- Wages are $w = 10$
- Rental rates are $r = 5$
- The factory's Production Function is $F(L,K) = 5L + 2K$

. . .

<br> 
The problem becomes:

$$
    \min \;\; 10L + 5K \;\;\; s.t. \;\;\; F(L,K) = 5L + 2K = 20,000
$$  

## Solving Cost Minimization Problems - New Terms {.smaller}

The methods to solve these problems are practically the same as we saw in Consumer Theory

However, we need to re-label some things:

::: {.incremental}
- The Marginal Rate of Substitution will not be named [Marginal Rate of Technological Substitution (MRTS)]{.hi}
    - This has a similar interpretation as before: 
        - [What is the firm's willingness to trade Labor for Capital]{.hi}
- Now, instead of using the ratio of marginal utilities, we will use the [ratio of marginal productivities]{.hi}
:::

. . . 

$$
    \text{MRTS} = \frac{MP_{L}}{MP_{K}} = \frac{\frac{\partial F}{\partial L}}{\frac{\partial F}{\partial K}} = \frac{\text{Marginal Productivity of Labor}}{\text{Marginal Productivity of Capital}}
$$

## Let's Solve the Jersey Problem {.smaller}

$$
    \min \;\; 10L + 5K \;\;\; s.t. \;\;\; F(L,K) = 5L + 2K = 20,000
$$  

The solution should look very familiar. We are trying to choose $L^{*}$ and $K^{*}$ that optimizes our productivity.

## Production Function Forms

. . . 

This is good news! It means that mathematically nothing should be suprising

We are just relabeling variables and using the same processes we already know

--- 

## Production Function Example

[Identify and find the MRTS for the following Production Function]{.hi .note .align-center}

$$
    F(L,K) = L^{1/3}K^{2/3}
$$

. . . 

<br>

$$
    \text{MRTS} = \frac{MP_{L}}{MP_{K}} = \frac{1/3 \cdot L^{-2/3}K^{2/3}}{2/3 \cdot L^{1/3}K^{-1/3}} = \frac{1/3}{2/3} \cdot \frac{K^{2/3}K^{1/3}}{L^{1/3}L^{2/3}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{K}{L}
$$

## What's Actually Different Then?

Although the problem we are solving is essentially the same, the levers we are pulling are not

Let's introduce some new (but familiar) concepts:

::: {.incremental}
- Production Functions have [Isoquants]{.hi} instead of Indifference Curves

- [Isoquants]{.hi} are all the possible combinations of [labor and capital]{.h} that produce a certain level of output

- Fortunately, they have the same shape as their Indifference Curves but instead of a level of Utility, they represent a level of quantity produced
:::

---

## Isoquants

Imagine that it takes exactly 20 minutes of labor (1/3 of an hour) [AND]{.hi} 10 units of capital to make one Ducks Jersey

. . .

[What form does this Production Function take?]{.h .note}

. . .

[Perfect Complements]{.hi .align-center}

![](images/isoquant-perfect-comps.png){fig-align="center" height=350}

---

## What's Actually Different? The Process

The key difference is a conceptual one:

- For consumers, we would [maximize the Utility Function, where the costs acted as our constraint]{.hi}

- For producers, we [minimize the cost function and the production function is the constraint]{.hi}

    - Additionally, we will call this cost function an [Isocost line]{.hi}

. . .

## Understanding the Differences Visually

---

## What is the Same?

Some things have not changed

::: {.incremental}
- The slope of the isoquant is the negative MRTS (-MRTS)
- The MRTS tells us the firm's willingness to trade away capital to get another unit of labor
- We still have a price ratio: $\frac{w}{r}$
