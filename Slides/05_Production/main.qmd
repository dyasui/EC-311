[Outline]{.hi .realbig}

### Chapter 6   

- Topics 

    - Producer Theory Basics (6.1)

    - Short-run vs Long-run (6.2, 6.3)

    - Cost Minimization Problems (6.4)

    - Returns to Scale (6.5) 

    - Technological Change (6.6)

## Big Picture

As economists, we want a model of [market economies]{.hi} based in [rational choice theory]{.hi}.

. . .

Why?

::: {.incremental}
- Make *positive* predictions about economics consequences of future world-events

- Guide [efficient]{.hi} production of market goods.
I.e., how to make the most of the limited resources we have

- Guide policy makers to craft [socially-efficient]{.hi} policies.
E.g., How to make public funds benefit the maximum amount of people in need?
:::

## Big Picture

Our first step was to construct a model of a [rational consumer]{.h}.

::: {.incremental}
- This allows us to predict what *will* people do when things change:

  * how income changes affect consumption

  * how price changes affect consumption and substitution

- ...without telling making judgements about what they *should* do
:::

## Big Picture

But markets are not only influenced by *consumers*, so now we will consider the other side; *firms*, or [producers]{.hi} of goods.

::: {.incremental}

- If *consumers* care about maximising their happines, what do we think [producers]{.hi} care about?

  * **Profit!** ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°

  * Meeting the needs of their consumers

    + could apply even to non-profits like government agencies or NGO's

:::

## Big Picture

Why should we care about what big corporations do with their inputs?

::: {.incremental}

- Because as consumers we are affected by the choices they make

- Our models here can be applied to sujects like anti-trust policy, environmental regulations, and other consumer welfare issues!

- We'll start off with assuming perfect competition, full information, no externalities, etc.
but by relaxing these assumptions we can apply our simple models to tackle big issues

## Why care about industrial production?

## Big Picture

Before we deal with the more interesting examples of [market failures]{.h},
we'll need to understand how the market works under optimal conditions:

- [perfect information]{.h}

- [many producers]{.h}

- [consumers internalize all costs/benefits privately]{.h} (no externalities)
