\begin{question}[type=exam]{6}
  Market research has revealed that the Netflix's target consumer has the following preferences over potential broadcasting bundles which consist of two hit shows: 
  seasons of \textit{Squid Game} ($SG$) and seasons of \textit{Stranger Things} ($ST$).
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \{1 $SG$, 3 $ST$\} is preferred to \{2 $SG$, 2 $ST$\}
    \item \{2 $SG$, 2 $ST$\} is preferred to \{3 $SG$, 1 $ST$\}
  \end{itemize}
  Would this consumer rather watch \{\textbf{1 season} of \textit{Squid Game} and \textbf{3 seasons} of \textit{Stranger Things}\} or \{\textbf{3 seasons} of \textit{Squid Game} and \textbf{1 season} of \textit{Stranger Things}\}?
