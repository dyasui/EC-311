\begin{question}[type=exam]{15}
  Suppose there are 100 identical consumers,
  each with an individual demand curve 
  $x_i = \frac{\vary{33}{44}}{p - \vary{5}{10}}$
  which depends on the market price $p$.

  \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]

    \item (\points{5})
      Derive the aggregate market demand curve $X$.

      Does this market demand curve satisfy the Law of Demand?
      Justify using a derivative.

  \item (\points{5})
    Suppose $p=\vary{10}{15}$.
    Find the price elasticity of the market demand function $\epsilon_{X,p}$.

  \item (\points{5})
    Based on your answer to part (b), is the market demand \textbf{elastic}, \textbf{inelastic}, or \textbf{unit elastic}?
  
  \end{enumerate}
