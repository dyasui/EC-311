\begin{question}[type=exam]{8}
  Consider my preferences for sandwich ingredients; slices of bread ($b$) and chicken tenders ($c$).

  Suppose that each sandwich requires exactly two slices of bread and one chicken tender.
  I get no utility from any leftover ingredients which are not included in a whole sandwich
  (open face sandwiches don't count as sandwiches).

  Create a utility function that models my preferences for bread and chicken ($U(b,c)$).

  What must be true of any bundle that maximizes my utility when my budget for these ingredients is constrained?
