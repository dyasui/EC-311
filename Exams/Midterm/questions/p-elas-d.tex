\begin{question}[type=exam]{8}
  Suppose the demand function for $x$ is $x^*(M,p_x,p_y) = M - 3 p_x - 2 p_y$,
  and that $M = \vary{19}{24}$, $p_x = \vary{1}{2}$, $p_y = \vary{2}{1}$.

  Solve for the own price elasticity of demand for $x$
  ($\epsilon_{x^*,p_x}$).
  Is this \textit{elastic}, \textit{inelastic}, or \textit{unit elastic}?

  Show all work. Leave your answer as a simplified fraction.
