\begin{question}[type=exam]{10}
  Consider the production decision of a firm who's production costs are represented by the
  marginal cost $MC$, average variable cost $AVC$, and average total cost $ATC$ curves below.

\begin{itemize}
\item  Suppose that in the \textbf{short-run}, the perfectly competitive market price is at a level represented by the horizontal line labelled $P$.
  Illustrate how much quantity the firm will produce in the short run on the graph.
  \item Now explain what will happen to this market in the \textbf{long-run} if firms are allowed to enter or exit.
  Use the graph to explain your answer.
\end{itemize}
