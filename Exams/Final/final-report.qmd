The average score out of 100 on the final exam was about 68.
This was an overall improvement of about 2 points over the midterm.

# Class Grade Distribution

After including the final exam, midterm, homeworks, quizzes, and participation, here is the overall distribution of the percentage grades in Canvas:

![](images/grade-distribution.pdf)

Because we achieved over 50% participation on course surveys, I dropped the percentile cutoffs each by 1%.
The 4th 34th and 79th percentile cutoffs are shown below next to the range of grades that get assigned to each letter.

| Score in Canvas at the end of class (%) | Letter Grade |
|:---------------:|:------------:|
| >90             | A            |
| 85-90           | A-           |
| 80-85           | B+           |
| 77-80           | B            |
| 74-77           | B-           |
| 70-74           | C+           |
| 65-70           | C            |
