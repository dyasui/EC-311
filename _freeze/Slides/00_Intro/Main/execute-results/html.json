The math is relatively straightforward, but it requires a good grasp on the theory to properly interpret it \n- More importantly than committing the theory to memory, the goal is to think like an economist\n    - There is a set logic in the theory that we will see and it should lead to predictable conclusions\n\n. . .\n\n- [I recognize that perhaps all of you are here for the requirement in your own programs, so my aim is to make it as relevant and interesting as possible]{.tiny}\n\n- [I'm not trying to convert you into economists, but rather have you takeaway things that you can apply in your own careers]{.tiny}\n\n---\n\n## Assignments {.smaller}\n\n[Achieve Online Learning]{.hi}\n\n::: {.incremental}\n- You [MUST]{.h} register for the course through Achieve\n- This is where you will complete your homework \n- It also gives you access to the digital version of the textbook\n- The course code is [xu5rmk]{.hp}\n- Your lowest homework grade will be dropped\n- 1 day grace period (with 5% penalty) $\\rightarrow$ no submissions allowed after that\n:::\n\n[Canvas Quizzes]{.hi}\n\n::: {.incremental}\n- Weekly quizzes that will help you get accustomed to how test questions will look\n- Roughly 10 questions with only one attempt allowed\n- Your lowest homework grade will be dropped\n- No late submissions allowed\n:::\n\n--- \n\n## Grades {.smaller}\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n[Homework]{.hi}\n\n::: {.incremental}\n- Achieve Homework (20%)\n    -

Complements\n    - Substitutes\n\n---\n\n## Supply {.align-center}\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Main_files/figure-revealjs/supply-line-1.png){fig-align='center' width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n---\n\n## Supply\n\n- [Supply]{.hp} is the [QUANTITY]{.hi} of goods available for sale at a given [PRICE]{.hi}\n\n. . .\n\n- The [Supply Curve]{.hp} shows the [RELATIONSHIP]{.hi} between [PRICES]{.hi} and [QUANTITY]{.hi} of a good for producers\n\n. . .\n\nWe also make the distinction between [Individual Supply]{.hii} and [Market Supply]{.hii}\n\n[Individual Supply:]{.hii} A Single Producer (One Firm)\n\n[Market Supply:]{.hii} All potential producers (All firms that are participating in the market)\n\n. . .\n\n[Note: The second half of the course will deal with how producers make their decisions]{.note .hii}\n\n---\n\n## Supply\n\nSome [Factors]{.hi} that may affect supply are:\n\n- Production Costs (Cost of Raw Materials, Technology, etc.)\n\n- Number of Sellers (Number of firms in the market)\n\n- Producers outside options\n\n---\n\n## Supply & Demand {.align-center}\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Main_files/figure-revealjs/supply-demand-1.png){fig-align='center' width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n[Put together they give us this classic graph]{.note .hii}\n\n---\n\n## Supply & Demand\n\nWhere these two are [equal to each other]{.hi-teal} (where they cross) we say it is the [market equilibrium]{.hi-teal}\n\nThe third part of the course will be about variations to the [classic market equilibrium]{.hii}\n\n- What happens when the market is deep (has many producers) [(Perfect Competition)]{.hi}\n\n- What happens when the market is shallow (only one producer) [(Monopoly)]{.hi}\n\n- What about other forms of competition where firms have some market power but not total market control? [(Imperfect Competition)]{.hi}\n\n---\n\n## Models\n\nWe can use all these to make very complex models of what we think the world looks like\n\nBut to begin, we need to develop the basics of:\n\n- What does [Demand]{.hi} look like?\n\n- What does [Supply]{.hi} look like?\n\n- What form of [Competition]{.hi} are we in?\n\n> Once we put all of these together we are modeling a market. With a model, you can begin to analyze the effects of changes to [Model Inputs]{.hi-teal} on [Model Outputs]{.hi-bb}\n\n---\n\n## Assumptions\n\nWe will work with models you have seen before and some new ones that are classified as \"classical economics\"\n\n. . .\n\nThese require certain assumptions in order to simplify the results:\n\n- Assume that individuals are [Rational and Self-Interested]{.hii}\n\n- Assume that markets have [No Externalities and Asymmetric Information]{.hii}\n\n---\n\n## Assumptions\n\nThese assumptions help make things simple and work to set a benchmark of sorts\n\nThey are often good approximations of the real world but are often not exact\n\nWe use these fundamental pieces of classical economics and build on top of them\n\n<br>\n\n[Note: I'm not attempting to describe the way the world works exactly, but rather give you a strating point for future endeavors]{.note .hi}\n\n---\n\n## Last Tool You Will Need\n\nWe will need calculus\n\nIt turns out that intermediate micro is fundamentally inseparable from multi-variate calculus\n\n. . .\n\n- I cannot show you where a demand curve comes from without using [(a tiny bit)]{.hi} of calculus\n\nSo the second thing we will do is discuss the math you will need in order to follow the material \n\n",
