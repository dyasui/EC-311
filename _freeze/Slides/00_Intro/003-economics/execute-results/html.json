[(Imperfect Competition)]{.hi}\n\n---\n\n## Models\n\nWe can use all these to make very complex models of what we think the world looks like\n\nBut to begin, we need to develop the basics of:\n\n- What does [Demand]{.hi} look like?\n\n- What does [Supply]{.hi} look like?\n\n- What form of [Competition]{.hi} are we in?\n\n> Once we put all of these together we are modeling a market. With a model, you can begin to analyze the effects of changes to [Model Inputs]{.hi-teal} on [Model Outputs]{.hi-bb}\n\n---\n\n## Assumptions\n\nWe will work with models you have seen before and some new ones that are classified as \"classical economics\"\n\n. . .\n\nThese require certain assumptions in order to simplify the results:\n\n- Assume that individuals are [Rational and Self-Interested]{.hii}\n\n- Assume that markets have [No Externalities and Asymmetric Information]{.hii}\n\n---\n\n## Assumptions\n\nThese assumptions help make things simple and work to set a benchmark of sorts\n\nThey are often good approximations of the real world but are often not exact\n\nWe use these fundamental pieces of classical economics and build on top of them\n\n<br>\n\n[Note: I'm not attempting to describe the way the world works exactly, but rather give you a strating point for future endeavors]{.note .hi}\n\n---\n\n## Last Tool You Will Need\n\nWe will need calculus\n\nIt turns out that intermediate micro is fundamentally inseparable from multi-variate calculus\n\n. . .\n\n- I cannot show you where a demand curve comes from without using [(a tiny bit)]{.hi} of calculus\n\nSo the second thing we will do is discuss the math you will need in order to follow the material ",
