So when comparing bundles A and B, you can always say one of the following:\n\n. . .\n\n- I prefer A to B ($A \\succeq B$)\n\n- I prefer B to A ($B \\succeq A$)\n\n- I am indifferent between A and B ($A \\sim B$) \n\n. . .\n\nThis allows us to compare and order any pair of bundles\n\n---\n\n## \"More is Better\"\n\nOr at least more is no worse than less\n\n. . .\n\nIn general, if a good is desirable we will want more of it\n\n- However, sometimes products can be bads (instead of goods) and we would, obviously, want less of those\n\n---\n\n## Transitivity\n\nPreferences are transitive. This means that when comparing bundles A, B, and C you can get logical orderings through rankings:\n\n. . . \n\n- If you prefer B to A ($B \\succeq A$) and C to B ($C \\succeq B$) then you must prefer C to A ($C \\succeq A$)\n\n. . .\n\n![](Images\\Transitivity-line.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n---\n\n## Transitivity\n\nWhat would this graph mean?\n\n![](Images\\Transitivity-Equal-line.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n. . .\n\nAll bundles are preferred equally!\n\n---\n\n## Preferences Assumptions\n\nAll of these are necessary to understand utility funcitons and be able to graph them\n\nTo do so we first need to learn about [Indifference Curves]{.hii}\n",
